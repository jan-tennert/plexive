# Deepscroll — Long-Form Content Structure

Schema specification for Deepscroll's long-form post format. Used for:
1. Database schema design (`sections` JSON column on `posts` table)
2. Frontend renderer implementation (one component per section type)
3. Post Creation Page: per-format AI generation prompts users copy when drafting a post with AI assistance
4. Bulk content seeding via Claude Research (separate master prompt — to be added later)

**Core principle:** Substance hooks first, deep dive in the middle, reference material at the bottom. Every drop-off point should feel like a complete mini-experience, not a cliffhanger. The driver is **curiosity**, not provocation.

All content is in English. Localization comes later.

---

## Format Overview

Quick reference for all 7 formats. Each format has its own logic but follows the same overall principle (substance first, deep dive middle, context last, mandatory quiz).

| Format | Tab | Core logic | Sections (req/total) | Reading time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Books | Books | Promise *about* a work; quotes early, core ideas as heart | 8 / 15 | 6–20 min |
| Facts | Facts | The fact *is* the hook; visual is constitutive | 7 / 14 | 5–15 min |
| People | People | Portrait + life arc carry the narrative | 9 / 16 | 7–18 min |
| Concepts | Ideas | Understanding the reader can actually apply | 8 / 15 | 5–17 min |
| Questions | Q&A | Steelmanned multi-perspective reflection; no "right answer" | 8 / 15 | 5–17 min |
| Stories | Stories | Narrative *is* the substance; spoiler discipline | 8 / 15 | 5–17 min |
| Academy | Academy | Research paper summary for domain experts | 12 / 23 | 7–18 min |

All formats end with a REQUIRED quiz (5–10 questions, Elo-relevant).

---

## 1. Style Guide

Format-agnostic rules. These are what separate Deepscroll from Wikipedia.

1. **Speak directly.** Use "you", "we", active verbs. Avoid "it has been shown that".
2. **Take a stance.** "This is Kahneman's strongest argument" beats "Kahneman argues that…". Curated selection with a clear point of view.
3. **Concrete before abstract.** Example first, then the rule.
4. **Show, don't tell.** Don't claim something is fascinating — demonstrate why.
5. **Respect hierarchy.** Most compelling material on top, mandatory context at the bottom. Never bury a bombshell in section 12.
6. **Use lists sparingly.** When prose flows better, use prose. Lists only when content is genuinely enumerative.
7. **No Wikipedia hedging.** Avoid "some have argued that possibly". Make clear claims with sources.
8. **Distribute visuals.** Not one diagram on top — spread across the post. Prefer Wikimedia Commons and royalty-free images. Diagrams as SVGs following the SVG standard.
9. **No buzzword vocabulary.** "Game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing" are banned. Substance over adjectives.
10. **Honest reading time.** If a post takes 8 minutes, say 8. Don't undersell to lure readers.

## 2. Implementation: Flexible Section Model

To allow adding, removing, and reordering sections later **without** wiping the database:

### Database Schema (recommended for Claude Code)

The `posts` table for long-form posts:

```sql
posts (
  id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  format          TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'books' | 'facts' | 'people' | 'concepts' | 'questions' | 'stories' | 'academy'
  slug            TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,    -- URL-friendly identifier
  feed_card       JSON NOT NULL,           -- the feed card object (fields vary per format)
  sections        JSON NOT NULL,           -- ordered array of section objects
  status          TEXT DEFAULT 'published', -- 'published' | 'pending'
  author_id       INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW,
  updated_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW
)
```

Recommended indexes:
- `format` (feed filtering per tab)
- `slug` (URL lookup, already UNIQUE)
- `author_id` (My Posts view)
- `status` (filter out pending submissions from feed)
- `created_at` (feed ordering)

Validation (REQUIRED sections present, correct shapes) happens at editor / post creation time via Pydantic schemas — not as DB constraints. This keeps the DB tolerant to schema evolution.

### Section JSON Structure

Each section in the `sections` array is an object:

```json
{
  "type": "essence",
  "order": 1,
  "content": "..."
}
```

`type` is the section identifier (one of the documented type strings per format). `order` controls render position. `content` shape varies per type — documented per section below.

### Frontend Renderer

A `<SectionRenderer>` component dispatches on `type` to load the matching sub-component. Unknown types are silently skipped (forward-compatible).

### Benefits of this model

- New section type → only a new renderer in the frontend, no DB migration
- Remove a section → only delete a JSON entry, other posts unaffected
- Reorder → only change `order` values
- REQUIRED/OPTIONAL is editor-side validation, not a DB constraint

Existing legacy fields on `posts` (`hook`, `key_points`, `details` etc.) remain for backward compatibility with short-form posts but are not used for new long-form posts.

**Note on shared types across formats:** Some section types (e.g. `voices`, `at_a_glance`) are reused across formats with the same structure but different headers (e.g. "Voices from the Book" vs. "In Their Own Words"). The renderer maps `type + format` to a header string in code, not in the DB.

---

## 3. Shared Section Types

These section types are used across multiple formats with **identical** content shape. The frontend renderer maps `type + format` to a header string in code (e.g. `voices` renders as "Voices from the Book" for books, "In Their Own Words" for people).

| Type | Content shape | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `quiz_badge` | `string` — short teaser line | Promise of quiz at the end |
| `quiz` | array of `{question, options[4], answer_index, explanation}` | 5–10 multiple-choice questions, affects Elo |
| `related_posts` | array of `{post_id, title, format, mini_teaser}` (length 3) | Internal links to similar posts |
| `sources` | array of `{label, url, type}` where type ∈ `wikipedia|paper|book|article|database` | References |
| `voices` | array of `{quote, attribution}` (length 3–4) | Quotes; header varies per format |

### Universal Post Metadata

Two fields appear in **every** format's feed card and `at_a_glance` section, with identical meaning:

- `post_reading_time_min` — integer, minutes of reading the post itself (not the underlying material)
- `post_difficulty` — 1, 2, or 3, where 1 = accessible, 2 = moderate, 3 = demanding. Note: for Academy, the scale shifts to expert-level (1 = adjacent fields, 3 = subfield specialist)

### `at_a_glance` — Same Type, Format-Specific Fields

`at_a_glance` is intentionally **not** in the shared types table above. It is a *generic container*: the type name and visual position are constant, but the fields inside vary by format. The frontend renderer iterates over the key-value pairs and renders them as a card. This allows each format to surface the metadata most relevant to its content (Books: pages, year, genre; People: birth/death, nationality, field; Academy: study type, pre-registration, replication status; etc.).

### Person-List Shape

Two section types reference lists of people (`key_figures` in Facts/`story`, `cast` in Stories, `authors_context` in Academy, `key_thinkers` in Concepts/`origin`). They share a **base shape** that may be extended:

```
{
  name: string,
  role: string,            // their function in the context
  one_line?: string,       // optional brief description
  lifespan?: string,       // optional "1867–1934" or "1929–present"
  image_url?: string,      // Wikimedia portrait or similar
  affiliation?: string     // for academic context
}
```

Different sections use different subsets of this shape — but never invent new field names for the same concept.

---

## 4. Visual Conventions

Every section that may contain a visual element uses the same four field names. This makes the frontend renderer trivial: one `<VisualBlock>` component handles all cases.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `visual_svg` | string (optional) | Inline SVG following the project SVG standard |
| `image_url` | string (optional) | URL to a Wikimedia Commons or royalty-free image |
| `image_caption` | string (optional) | Caption shown below the visual |
| `image_attribution` | string (optional) | License/source credit for the image (essential for Wikimedia compliance) |

**Rules:**
- A section may have neither, one, or both of `visual_svg` and `image_url`
- `image_caption` and `image_attribution` apply to both
- The renderer prefers `visual_svg` over `image_url` if both are present (SVGs scale crisply)
- For SVGs: `viewBox="0 0 400 300"`, `currentColor` for neutral elements, fixed accent color for highlights, no shadows/filters/gradients

**Not part of Visual Conventions:**
- `formalism` section in Academy uses `equations` (array of LaTeX strings) — that's a separate primitive, not a visual
- `mini_visual_svg` and `teaser_visual_svg` in feed cards — different context (pre-click teasers), kept as their own fields

---

## 5. Forward Compatibility Rules

The flexible section model only works if the frontend renderer is **robust**. These rules apply to the implementation:

1. **Unknown section types are silently skipped.** If the backend returns a section with `type: "audio_clip"` and no renderer exists for that type, the post still renders — the section just doesn't appear. No errors, no warnings to users.

2. **Missing optional fields don't crash the renderer.** A section like `{type: "core_ideas", content: [...]}` where individual items have `visual_svg` but no `image_url` (or vice versa, or neither) must render correctly.

3. **Extra fields are ignored, not rejected.** If a new field is added to a section type (e.g. `audio_url` added to `voices`), older renderer code that doesn't know the field simply ignores it. The post stays valid.

4. **Sections render in `order` value, not array position.** This allows reordering without rebuilding posts — just change the `order` values.

5. **REQUIRED is enforced at editor/validation time, not at render time.** A post missing a required section still renders what it has. Validation happens when posts are submitted/edited.

### What this allows without DB migration

- **Adding a new section type** → only a new renderer component
- **Adding fields to an existing section** → only renderer update (old posts continue working)
- **Changing array length limits** (e.g. core_ideas from 6–12 to 6–15) → only prompt update + editor validation
- **Reordering sections** → only `order` values in new posts
- **Removing a section type** → just stop creating it; existing posts continue rendering (or remove renderer → silent skip)

### What requires migration (rare cases)

- Changing a field's *data type* (e.g. `post_reading_time_min` from integer to string) — would need to update all existing posts
- Renaming a section type string (e.g. `core_ideas` → `key_ideas`) — would need a one-time SQL `UPDATE` to rewrite the type names in existing JSON
- These cases should be avoided; if they occur, a simple migration script can update all rows in one pass

| `cover` | Book cover image, left, large. Open Library API. Placeholder with format color if unavailable |
| `title` | Book title, primary typography |
| `author` | Author name, secondary typography |
| `essence` | One sentence stating what the book is. Factual and dense, no clickbait |
| `teasers` | 3 teaser bullets, max ~6 words each. For non-fiction: concepts ("Habit Stacking", "The 1% Rule"). For fiction: themes ("Guilt without punishment", "Übermensch theory") |

- Section 8 (`angles`): each angle may/should have its own mini-visual
- Section 9 (`story`): Wikimedia portraits of researchers, historical illustrations
- Section 10 (`bigger_picture`): another diagram welcome if it shows the implication

Images preferred Wikimedia Commons + royalty-free. Diagrams as SVGs per standard.

## AI Generation Prompt — People

Lives on the Post Creation page. User copies this prompt, appends source material (biography, articles, etc.) and runs it in an AI chat.

```
You are writing a Deepscroll long-form post about a person. Deepscroll is an open social media app whose feed replaces doomscrolling with valuable content. Output must be a single JSON object that follows the schema below exactly.

PRINCIPLE
The driver is curiosity, not provocation. For people, the face is the visual hook and the life arc carries the narrative. Substance comes first, deep dive in the middle, mandatory context at the bottom. Each drop-off point in the post should still feel like a complete mini-experience.

STYLE RULES
1. Speak directly: "you", "we", active verbs. No "it has been shown that".
2. Take a stance with clear point of view, not Wikipedia neutrality.
3. Concrete before abstract: example first, then the rule.
4. Show, don't tell — demonstrate, don't claim.
5. Respect hierarchy: best material first, mandatory last.
6. Use lists sparingly; prefer prose when it flows better.
7. No Wikipedia hedging; make clear claims and cite them.
8. Distribute visuals across the post. Portrait is essential. Use Wikimedia Commons or royalty-free historical images. Diagrams as SVG (viewBox "0 0 400 300", currentColor for neutral elements, no shadows or gradients).
9. No buzzword vocabulary ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing" etc.).
10. Honest reading time — match the actual read length, don't undersell.

LANGUAGE
English only.

STYLE RULES
1. Speak directly: "you", "we", active verbs. No "it has been shown that".
2. Take a stance on the strength of each perspective separately — but never suggest the question itself has a "correct" answer. Steelman every position.
3. Concrete before abstract: scenario first, then the principle.
4. Show, don't tell — demonstrate, don't claim.
5. Respect hierarchy: best material first, mandatory last.
6. Use lists sparingly; prefer prose when it flows better.
7. No Wikipedia hedging on perspectives; each one is presented as if its proponents are right.
8. Distribute visuals across the post. Prefer Wikimedia Commons or royalty-free images. Diagrams as SVG (viewBox "0 0 400 300", currentColor for neutral elements, no shadows or gradients).
9. No buzzword vocabulary ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing" etc.).
10. Honest reading time — match the actual read length, don't undersell.

# Format: Stories

## Feed Card (Pre-Click)

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `era_label` | Small label above: "1944", "Ancient Rome", "The Cold War", "Last Year"… Sets the temporal frame instantly |
| `headline` | The hook line — sets stakes and atmosphere *without* revealing the twist. Past tense, scenic. "A man bought a wooden box at a flea market in 2007. The contents would unmake a fortune." |
| `lead_image` | Historical photo, Wikimedia or royalty-free. Strong visual presence |
| `teasers` | 3 bullets — *atmosphere and stakes*, not events ("A century of silence", "What three witnesses saw", "The letter that survived") |
| `meta` | `post_reading_time_min` · `post_difficulty (1–3)` · `era` · `category` (true crime, historical mystery, scientific discovery, personal saga, political turning point…) |

**Critical rule:** No teaser may spoil the twist. Aim for "I need to know what happened" — not "I know what happened, let me read the details".

**Tone of the card:** The hook is *promise of story*, not promise of information. The reader should feel "I want to be inside this".

## Detail View Sections

### Part 1 — The Opening (~60 sec read)

| # | Type | Section | Status | Content shape |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | `cold_open` | **The Cold Open** — first sentence/paragraph that drops the reader into the moment. Like a film's opening shot. No exposition, just immersion. 2–4 sentences max | REQUIRED | `string` |
| 2 | `quiz_badge` | **Quiz Badge** | REQUIRED | `string` |
| 3 | `at_a_glance` | **At a Glance** — compact card: era · location · category · sources_reliability (1–3, where 3 = primary documents, 1 = mostly oral/legendary) · post_reading_time_min · post_difficulty (1–3). Crucially: *no plot summary* | REQUIRED | object |

### Part 2 — The Story (the heart, ~5–12 min read)

The narrative itself, broken into **chapters** rather than micro-sections. Each chapter is a substantial narrative block (4–10 sentences), titled scenically.

| # | Type | Section | Status | Content shape |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 4 | `setting` | **Setting the Scene** — time, place, who matters, what the world was like. Establishes stakes before the action. 1 narrative block + optional period image | REQUIRED | `{body, image_url?, image_caption?}` |
| 5 | `chapters` | **The Story Itself** — 3–7 chapters, each scenically titled (e.g. "The First Letter", "What the Maid Saw", "The Decision"). Each chapter is a real narrative block — written like prose, not bullet points. Optional images interspersed. Pacing matters: chapters can vary in length, building tension toward the turning point | REQUIRED | array of `{title, body (4–10 sentences of narrative prose), image_url?, image_caption?}` (length 3–7) |
| 6 | `the_turn` | **The Turn** — the moment everything changes. The revelation, the twist, the disaster, the breakthrough. For stories without a sharp twist, this is the pivotal phase. Treated as its own beat — short, sharp, given visual emphasis | REQUIRED | `{body, image_url?, image_caption?}` |
| 7 | `the_aftermath` | **The Aftermath** — what happened next. Days, years, sometimes decades. Where the story actually ends | REQUIRED | `{body, image_url?, image_caption?}` |

### Part 3 — Reflection (~2 min read)

| # | Type | Section | Status | Content shape |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 8 | `what_it_means` | **Why History Remembers This** — what makes this story endure? What does it tell us about its time, about people, about institutions? Analytical, not narrative. The reader is now ready to think | REQUIRED | `string` |
| 9 | `what_we_learn` | **What It Teaches** — the broader lesson or pattern. Closest thing Stories has to "What Stays With You". Not heavy-handed moralizing — observation | OPTIONAL | `string` |
| 10 | `unanswered` | **What We Still Don't Know** — gaps in the record, contested details, mysteries that remain. Intellectual honesty about what's known vs. legendary | OPTIONAL | `string` |

### Part 4 — Test Yourself

| # | Type | Section | Status | Content shape |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 11 | `quiz` | **Quiz** — tests comprehension, key figures, sequence of events, broader context — not trivia | REQUIRED | (shared shape) |
| 12 | `related_posts` | **Stories That Echo This** — 3 internal links: stories with similar themes, the people involved, or the era | OPTIONAL | (shared shape) |

### Part 5 — Context (smaller typography, secondary)

| # | Type | Section | Status | Content shape |
|---|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| 13 | `cast` | **The Cast** — brief portraits of 2–4 key figures with Wikimedia images, lifespans, one-line description. For complex stories with multiple players | OPTIONAL | array of `{name, role, one_line?, lifespan?, image_url?}` (length 2–4) |
| 14 | `historical_context` | **The Era** — broader historical context: what else was happening, what readers should know about the period to grasp the stakes fully | OPTIONAL | `string` |
| 15 | `sources` | **Sources & Further Reading** | REQUIRED | (shared shape) |

## Size & Tension

- **Minimal post:** 8 required sections + ~3 chapters ≈ 11 blocks (~5–7 min)
- **Maximal post:** all 15 + 7 chapters ≈ 22 blocks (~12–17 min)

## Spoiler Discipline (Stories-specific)

Stories is the only format where the twist must not appear in early sections. Concretely:
- Feed card teasers describe atmosphere and stakes, never events
- `cold_open` and `setting` build immersion without revealing the turning point
- `at_a_glance` deliberately omits plot summary
- Quiz questions may test the twist (post-read it's fair game)

## AI Generation Prompt — Stories

Lives on the Post Creation page. User copies this prompt, appends source material (historical accounts, interviews, books, documents), runs it in an AI chat.

```
You are writing a Deepscroll long-form post about a story — a historical event, mystery, personal saga, scientific discovery moment, true crime case, or political turning point. Deepscroll is an open social media app whose feed replaces doomscrolling with valuable content. Output must be a single JSON object that follows the schema below exactly.

PRINCIPLE
The driver is curiosity, not provocation. For stories, the narrative itself is the substance — pacing matters more than structure. The story is told first, in scenic prose, and reflection comes after. Spoilers are forbidden in early sections.

STYLE RULES
1. Speak directly: "you", "we" only in reflection sections; the narrative itself is told in third person, past tense, scenic.
2. Take a stance on what the story means in the reflection sections — but tell the story itself with restraint and respect for the facts.
3. Concrete before abstract: scenes before generalizations.
4. Show, don't tell — render moments, don't summarize them.
5. Respect hierarchy: scenic opening first, reflection only after the story is told, context last.
6. Use lists sparingly; the story itself must read as prose, not bullet points.
7. No Wikipedia hedging; make clear claims and cite them. Distinguish what's documented from what's contested.
8. Distribute visuals across the post. Use Wikimedia Commons historical images and period photos. Diagrams as SVG only when genuinely useful (maps, timelines).
9. No buzzword vocabulary ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing" etc.).
10. Honest reading time — match the actual read length, don't undersell.

SPOILER DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL)
This rule overrides all others where they conflict.
- The `headline` in feed_card, the teasers, the `cold_open`, the `setting`, and `at_a_glance` must NOT reveal the turning point or final outcome.
- These early sections build atmosphere, set stakes, and establish characters — they do not pre-tell the story.
- The twist or pivotal moment appears in `the_turn`, not earlier.
- Quiz questions may reference the twist (the reader has read it by then).

LANGUAGE
English only.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly one JSON object:
{
  "feed_card": { ... },

SECTIONS
Include every REQUIRED section. For each OPTIONAL section, include it only if it adds real value for this specific story. Use this order:

1. cold_open — REQUIRED. content: string, 2–4 sentences max. Drops the reader into a moment. Like a film's opening shot. No exposition.
2. quiz_badge — REQUIRED. content: string. Format: "🎯 N questions at the end — earn Elo" where N matches your quiz length.
3. at_a_glance — REQUIRED. content: { era, location, category, sources_reliability (1–3 where 3 = primary documents, 1 = mostly oral/legendary), post_reading_time_min, post_difficulty (1–3) }. Crucially: NO plot summary fields.
4. setting — REQUIRED. content: { body, image_url?, image_caption? }. Time, place, who matters, what the world was like. Establishes stakes before action. No spoilers.
5. chapters — REQUIRED. content: array of length 3–7, each item { title (scenically titled, not summary-titled), body (4–10 sentences of narrative prose), image_url? (period image), image_caption? }. The actual story, written as prose. Pacing matters — chapters can vary in length, building tension.
6. the_turn — REQUIRED. content: { body, image_url?, image_caption? }. The pivotal moment — revelation, twist, disaster, breakthrough. Short, sharp. For stories with no sharp twist, this is the pivotal phase rather than a single moment.
7. the_aftermath — REQUIRED. content: { body, image_url?, image_caption? }. What happened next. Days, years, sometimes decades.
8. what_it_means — REQUIRED. content: string. Analytical, not narrative. Why history remembers this; what it tells us about the time, people, institutions.
9. what_we_learn — OPTIONAL. content: string. Broader lesson or pattern. Observation, not moralizing. Skip if the story resists a clean lesson.
10. unanswered — OPTIONAL. content: string. Gaps in the record, contested details, mysteries that remain. Include for stories with genuine open questions.
11. quiz — REQUIRED. content: array of length 5–10, each item { question, options (length 4), answer_index (0–3), explanation (one sentence) }. Test comprehension, key figures, sequence, broader context — not trivia.
12. related_posts — OPTIONAL. content: array of length 3, each item { post_id (leave empty string if not known), title, format, mini_teaser (one sentence) }.
13. cast — OPTIONAL. content: array of length 2–4, each item { name, role, one_line?, lifespan?, image_url? }. For stories with multiple key players. Skip for solo stories.
14. historical_context — OPTIONAL. content: string. Broader historical context — what else was happening, what readers should know about the period.
15. sources — REQUIRED. content: array of { label, url, type } where type ∈ "wikipedia", "paper", "book", "article", "database".

# Format: Academy

Academy posts target domain experts and advanced students. The goal is **not** simplification — fachsprache and notation are allowed without translation. Accessibility comes through *structure*, not through dumbing down. A neuroscientist reading a Machine Learning paper should be able to follow; an undergrad in the field should be able to read with effort.

## Feed Card (Pre-Click)

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `field` | Field label small above title: "Cognitive Neuroscience", "Machine Learning", "Quantum Optics"… |
| `title` | Paper title (truncated if needed), primary typography |
| `authors_compact` | "Smith et al., 2024" |
| `key_finding_one_line` | The core finding in one technical sentence — the kind of one-liner you'd hear at a conference summary. NOT dumbed down |
| `teasers` | 3 bullets — methodological highlights or key claims ("Pre-registered, n=1,200", "Bayesian model outperforms baseline", "Kahneman 2011 fails to replicate") |
| `meta` | `post_reading_time_min` · `post_difficulty (1–3)` · `published_year` · `venue` (journal/conference acronym) |

**Tone of the card:** "The paper that matters in your field this week." Reader thinks "Have I read this? Should I?"

```
You are writing a Deepscroll long-form post about an academic paper. Deepscroll is an open social media app whose feed replaces doomscrolling with valuable content. Academy posts target domain experts and advanced students. The output must be a single JSON object that follows the schema below exactly.

PRINCIPLE
The driver is curiosity, not provocation. Accessibility for Academy comes through structure, not through dumbing down. Technical fachsprache and notation are allowed without translation. A neuroscientist reading an ML paper should be able to follow; an advanced undergrad in the field should be able to read with effort. Substance comes first, methodology in the middle, critique and implications at the end. Each drop-off point should still feel like a complete mini-experience.

STYLE RULES
1. Speak directly: "you", "we", active verbs. No "it has been shown that".
2. Take a stance — distinguish what's strong from what's weak in the paper. Don't be neutral about quality.
3. Concrete before abstract within sections, but the overall structure is technical from the start.
4. Show, don't tell — let methodology and effect sizes speak.
5. Respect hierarchy: TL;DR + Headline Figure first, methodology and findings middle, context last.
6. Use lists sparingly; prefer prose when it flows better.
7. No Wikipedia hedging; make clear claims and cite them.
8. Distribute visuals across the post. Headline Figure is required — either the paper's most important figure (with source credit) or a rebuilt SVG. Diagrams as SVG (viewBox "0 0 400 300", currentColor for neutral elements, no shadows or gradients).
9. No buzzword vocabulary ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "mind-blowing", "groundbreaking" etc.).
10. Honest reading time — match the actual read length, don't undersell.

CRITICAL RULES FOR ACADEMY
- Technical terminology is allowed and expected in all sections including the Quiz. Do not translate p-values, effect sizes, method names, or notation into layman's terms.
- The "Big Idea" section, if included, is NOT simplification for laypeople. It is a translation for experts from adjacent fields — keep scientific level intact, only drop domain-specific notation.
- Limitations contains only what the authors themselves admit. Objections contains the community's broader critique. Do not conflate them.
- Implications stays within the field. Connections to Other Fields handles cross-disciplinary bridges.
- Result direction must be reported honestly. Null results and negative findings are not "weaker" — often they are more important than positive findings.

7. the_big_idea — OPTIONAL. content: string, one paragraph. Translation of the paper's central idea for experts from adjacent fields. No domain-specific notation, but scientific level intact. Skip if the paper is so narrowly technical that no adjacent-field translation is meaningful.
8. field_context — OPTIONAL. content: { body, key_priors? (array of {citation, claim}) }. Prior work, key disagreements, why this question now. Assumes domain knowledge.
9. approach — REQUIRED. content: { body, visual_svg?, image_url? }. Methodology at technical level. Design choices, why this design, what it controls for.
10. formalism — OPTIONAL. content: { body, equations (array of {latex, label?, description}), notation_legend? (array of {symbol, meaning}) }. Include for theoretical/mathematical papers. KaTeX-rendered LaTeX strings.
11. data_or_sample — OPTIONAL. content: string. What data, what subjects, what conditions. Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Power analysis if relevant.
12. key_findings — REQUIRED. content: array of length 3–7, each item { title, finding (stated technically), effect_size? (string, e.g. "d = 0.42", "AUC = 0.91"), statistical_detail? (p-values, CIs, etc.), source_in_paper? ("Table 2", "Fig. 4b"), visual_svg?, image_url?, image_caption? }.
13. figures — OPTIONAL. content: array of length 1–4, each item { figure_label, image_url, image_caption, image_attribution }. Additional data figures from the paper with technical captions.
14. robustness — OPTIONAL. content: string. Sensitivity analyses, alternative specifications, internal replications. What survives scrutiny.
15. limitations — REQUIRED. content: string. ONLY what the authors themselves admit cannot be concluded. Stay close to the paper's own discussion.
16. objections — OPTIONAL. content: string. The community's broader critique beyond what authors admit. Peer review responses, follow-up papers, counterarguments. Skip if the paper is too new for community response.
17. implications — REQUIRED. content: string. What this changes within the field. For theory, practice, future research directions.
18. connections_to_other_fields — OPTIONAL. content: string. Interdisciplinary bridges. Where this paper opens up to or constrains other disciplines. Skip if the paper is purely intra-field.
19. quiz — REQUIRED. content: array of length 5–10, each item { question, options (length 4), answer_index (0–3), explanation (one sentence). Technical terminology is allowed and encouraged. Test comprehension of method, finding, and limitations — not trivia.
20. related_posts — OPTIONAL. content: array of length 3, each item { post_id (leave empty string if not known), title, format, mini_teaser (one sentence) }.
21. authors_context — OPTIONAL. content: array of { name, role, one_line?, affiliation?, image_url? } (where role describes their function on the paper, e.g. "Lead author", "Senior author", and one_line gives a brief note on prior work). Lead + senior author usually sufficient. Skip for routine papers.
22. historical_context — OPTIONAL. content: string. Include only for landmark papers — how the paper came to be written, intellectual or institutional context.
23. sources — REQUIRED. content: array of { label, url, type } where type ∈ "wikipedia", "paper", "book", "article", "database".
