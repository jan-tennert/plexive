# Scoring formula (plain English):
# Each post starts with a base score of 1.0.
# Posts whose interest tags overlap with the user's selected interests gain +2.0 per matching tag.
# Posts in formats the user has engaged with over the last 30 days gain a bonus of 0 to +3.0,
#   calculated as (avg view duration in ms + like count for that format), normalised so the
#   most-engaged format receives 3.0 and all others scale proportionally.
# Posts that have been viewed before lose 1.0 per recorded view event (last 30 days), with a
#   floor of 0 so the score never goes negative.
# The final score is multiplied by random.uniform(0.85, 1.15) to keep the feed from being
#   perfectly deterministic on every load.
