"""Derive and maintain the post-graph edges (post_edges table).

Block 1 gave every post an identity_key and added the post_edges table; this
module makes the edges live. A post's outgoing edges are derived on write from
its connections (links to non-person posts) and its featured person-list entries
(links to people). Edges are gated on status='published': only a live post is a
node and casts live edges.

One assembly path: both a post's own key and an incoming connection ref's key go
through graph_identity._key_from_parts, so they can never drift. A ref or person
entry that does not yield a complete key (a legacy string ref, a structured ref
missing a part, a person without a coercible birth_year) is skipped cleanly --
no edge, no exception, never a partial key. Old (string) and new (structured)
authoring shapes therefore coexist safely while the seed data is migrated later.

read_next (the post-detail "read next" set) is a small read-time projection of
the featured edges, resolved against live posts; see resolved_read_next.
