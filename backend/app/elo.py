"""Elo-style knowledge score.

Each user has one rating per format (starting at 1000). Every quiz question
acts as an opponent whose rating is derived from the post's difficulty:
post_difficulty 1 -> 800, 2 -> 1000, 3 -> 1200.

Standard Elo update: R' = R + K * (S - E) where S is 1 (correct) or 0 (wrong)
and E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Q - R) / 400)) is the expected score against a question
rated Q. Wrong answers therefore always cost points, so guessing has a cost.

K is 32 for a user's first 30 answers in a format (ratings converge quickly
while provisional) and 16 afterwards (stable scores move slowly). Ratings are
floored at 100 so a losing streak can never produce absurd negative numbers.

The global score is the average of the user's per-format ratings, over the
formats where the user has answered at least one question.
