"""Identity keys for the post graph.

Posts are nodes; connections are natural-identity strings one post declares to
others ("Title by Author", "Name (birth_year)", or a bare title -- never a slug
or UUID, see docs/content-structure/BULK_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md). To resolve those
declared links to real posts (Block 2), every post gets a normalized identity_key
computed from its own format-specific parts.

A post's own key and an incoming connection ref's key MUST go through one assembly
path so they can never drift: _key_from_parts() takes structured parts and returns
the canonical key. Block 2 resolves a ref by parsing it into the same structured
parts and calling _key_from_parts() -- it must NOT rebuild a string and normalize
it separately.

Aliases (extension point, not built)
------------------------------------
A post's canonical key stays exactly as _key_from_parts() builds it. To let a post
also answer to alternate identity strings (e.g. Laozi / Lao Tzu) without renaming
it, a post could later declare alias strings in the JSON authoring layer (in
feed_card, or a JSONB column added the same non-breaking way add_graph_columns.py
added tags/connections). At write those aliases normalize through the SAME
_key_from_parts() into alternate keys; activation (graph_edges.activate_edges_for)
would then match latent edges on the canonical key OR any alias key. Edges already
key on (format, identity_key) and post_edges already has a `kind` column, so no
edge-schema change and no migration are needed -- aliases are additive (none today
== today's behavior). The mis-keyed entries surfaced by graph_edges.
unmatched_latent_edges are exactly what an alias would later resolve.

Build this only on the first real cross-spelling collision between two existing
posts -- not preemptively (the fold rule is deliberately not expanded to chase
variants, since no single rule catches all). Until then such edges stay correctly
latent and surface in scripts/report_unmatched_edges.py.
