//     shown as the profile "Knowledge score") and returns the authoritative
//     rating + delta. Correctness is still decided here against the mock
//     answerIndex and trusted by the server (see the note in ../../types/train.ts);
//     it must move server-side once a real Train question backend exists.
//   - Guests: pure client-side simulation via ./elo.ts (nothing is persisted).
//
// All marathon math (Elo simulator + difficulty weighting) lives in ./elo.ts so
// it stays pure and testable; this file only handles selection from the pool and
// shaping the AnswerResult.

//
// fetchNextQuestion -> still selects from the local mock pool. A real Train
//   backend should GET the next question for the user (server-run adaptive
//   selection) and return a MarathonQuestion with `answerIndex`/`explanation`
//   STRIPPED so correctness is not knowable client-side.
//
// Server-side correctness -> /api/train/answer currently TRUSTS the client's
//   `correct` flag because there is no server question bank. Once questions live
//   server-side, the endpoint must decide correctness itself (as /quiz/answer
//   already does) and stop accepting `correct` from the client.
