# Deepscroll Architecture

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

```
backend/
  requirements.txt              fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, passlib[bcrypt], python-jose[cryptography], python-dotenv, email-validator, supabase
  .env.example                  JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY templates (copy to .env, never commit .env)
  seed.py                       idempotent: get-or-create 145 interests from taxonomy; reads SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD from backend/.env; get-or-create @Marlo (marlo07drews@gmail.com, is_verified=2); auto-discovers all *_example.json files in docs/content-structure/examples/ — upserts one post per file (format derived from filename, title from feed_card.title|concept_name|the_question|headline|name); upsert key is (author_id, format) so title changes do not create duplicates; FORMAT_INTEREST_SLUGS dict maps format → interest slugs (books/facts/people/concepts/questions/stories defined)
  tests/_throwaway_db.py        sets DATABASE_URL to a temp SQLite file + blanks SUPABASE env BEFORE app import; every test file imports it first so suites can never touch the real DB or storage
  tests/smoke_test.py           end-to-end API smoke test (quiz/Elo, avatar via fake Supabase storage client, user search) against a throwaway SQLite DB (via _throwaway_db); run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\smoke_test.py (needs httpx)
  tests/chat_test.py            end-to-end chat test (conversation rules, history authz, websocket auth/send/broadcast/rejection) against a throwaway SQLite DB (via _throwaway_db); run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\chat_test.py
  tests/security_test.py        regression test for the June 2026 security review fixes; throwaway SQLite DB via _throwaway_db; run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\security_test.py
  scripts/cleanup_smoke_test_data.sql  one-time manual cleanup of smoke-test rows accidentally written to the live DB on 2026-06-11 (run by hand, never from the app)
  scripts/add_graph_columns.py  one-time manual ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tags/connections JSONB default '[]' for the live DB; idempotent; run by hand, never from the app
  scripts/add_indexes.py        one-time manual CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS for the live DB (events post_id+event_type/user_id/created_at, comments post_id, follows following_id+status); names match models.py; idempotent; run by hand, never from the app
  tests/perf_probe.py           endpoint timing probe against a running backend (--out saves timings + bodies for before/after comparison); authed endpoints via seed-admin login, token cached to respect rate limits
  tests/_db_inspect.py          legacy SQLite helper (no longer used; DB is Supabase PostgreSQL)
  app/
    database.py                 engine (PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL env var; pool_recycle=1200 + connect_timeout=10 on PG only — pool_pre_ping measured and rejected, +1 round trip per request), SessionLocal, Base, get_db dependency
    main.py                     FastAPI app, CORS origins from FRONTEND_ORIGIN env (default localhost:3000, "*" stripped), 10 MB request body cap middleware, router registration, create_all on startup; no StaticFiles mount (files served from Supabase Storage)
    models.py                   ORM models: Interest, Post (feed_card JSON not null, sections JSON not null, tags JSON not null default [] + connections JSON not null default [] (graph fields, added to live DB via scripts/add_graph_columns.py), is_user_content Boolean not null default False, author_id FK→users nullable; indexes on format/status/created_at; author_username, author_is_verified and author_avatar_url as properties), Event (user_id nullable FK; indexes: (post_id,event_type) composite, user_id, created_at — apply to the live DB once via scripts/add_indexes.py), User (posts relationship, is_verified Integer default 0, is_private boolean default false, bio string nullable, avatar_url string nullable, knowledge_rating float nullable + knowledge_answered_count int — single unified knowledge score), Follow (follower_id FK→users, following_id FK→users, status "pending"|"accepted", created_at; UniqueConstraint uq_follow), QuizAnswer (user_id+post_id+question_index unique, chosen_index, is_correct, rating_delta), Comment, post_interests join table (legacy user_elo table no longer modeled — replaced by users.knowledge_rating)
    elo.py                      single unified knowledge score on users.knowledge_rating (= profile Knowledge score = Train Elo): start 1000, floor 100, K=32 first 30 answers then 16, question rating 800/1000/1200 from difficulty; apply_answer(user) for quizzes, apply_answer_timed(user) adds the marathon time bonus (FAST_MS/SLOW_MS/TIME_BONUS_MAX); elo_summary() returns the rating (None until first answer) + empty formats dict for response-shape compatibility
    auth.py                     hash_password, verify_password, create_access_token, decode_access_token, get_current_user, get_optional_user (returns User|None, used for optional auth)
    schemas.py                  Pydantic v2 models: 15 section types with Literal discriminator → AnySection union; BooksFeedCard; PostCreate (Books required sections: essence/quiz_badge/voices/at_a_glance/heart/core_ideas/takeaway/quiz/sources; image_url recursive check for Supabase storage URL prefix); PostOut (feed_card dict, sections list[dict], tags list[str] + connections list[dict] (graph fields, default []), is_user_content bool, like_count int, comment_count int; strips answer_index+explanation from quiz sections so answers never reach the client); PostListOut (PostOut subclass for list endpoints: serializes sections as [] — no list view renders sections, detail page refetches GET /api/posts/{id}); UserOut (incl. avatar_url), InterestOut, EventIn, UploadResponse, SvgUploadResponse
    sanitize.py                 validate_image() — sync (runs in threadpool via sync def endpoints; reads file.file), chunked read, magic-byte check, animated-GIF reject, Pillow re-encode; sanitize_svg() / sanitize_svg_text() — defusedxml XXE check, lxml element+attribute whitelist, dangerous-pattern rejection
    upload_config.py            Supabase client (SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY from env), SUPABASE_BUCKET="uploads", size limits (5 MB images, 512 KB SVGs)
    rate_limit.py               in-memory per-user rate limiter (dict of timestamps); check_rate_limit(user_id, key, max, window_secs); identity may also be a string ("ip:...", "email:...") for unauthenticated endpoints; idle buckets swept every 10 min (snapshot iteration, pop-with-default) so memory stays bounded
    post_counts.py              attach_counts(posts, db) / attach_counts_one(post, db) — batched like_count+comment_count attachment shared by posts/feed/search routers
    scoring.py                    score_posts() — interest match (tier-scaled), format engagement, repeat penalty; engagement read as one joined tuple query (events x post format, last 30 days)
    routers/
      interests.py              GET /api/interests
      feed.py                   GET /api/feed — three-tier: direct matches → related co-tags → all remaining; GET /api/feed/following (auth, posts from followed users, limit 50); GET /api/feed/user/{username} (no auth, published posts by user, limit 50); all three respond with PostListOut (sections serialized as [])

      events.py                 POST /api/events (captures user_id when auth token present; deduplicates "like" events per user+post for auth users via one IN query per batch, also within a batch; max 50 events/batch; unknown post ids dropped); GET /api/posts/{id}/likes → {count, liked} in one COUNT+MAX(CASE) query when authed; pending posts 404 for non-authors
      auth.py                   POST /api/auth/register (10/hr per IP; username must match ^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{3,30}$ — forward-only), POST /api/auth/login (10/5min per email + 30/5min per IP), GET /api/auth/me, PATCH /api/auth/me (update username/password/is_private/bio; same username rule), POST /api/auth/me/avatar (multipart, validate_image pipeline, 10/hr), DELETE /api/auth/me (soft delete: sets is_active=False)
      follows.py                POST /api/users/{username}/follow (60/hr); DELETE /api/users/{username}/follow; POST /api/users/{username}/follow/accept; DELETE /api/users/{username}/follow/reject; GET /api/users/{username}/followers; GET /api/users/{username}/following (private lists visible to owner + accepted followers); GET /api/users/{username}/follow-requests (auth, own only); GET /api/users/{username}/profile (no auth, returns counts + follow_status; follower/following/post counts in one multi-subselect SELECT); all user payloads include avatar_url
      search.py                 GET /api/search — Python-side search across post.title, feed_card.essence, feed_card.author, heart section content, core_ideas title+body (matching reads ORM sections pre-serialization; response is PostListOut with sections []); ranked by title-match then recency; limit 50; GET /api/search/users — username substring search, prefix matches first, limit 20, follow_status per row when authed; both: q max 100 chars, 60/min per user or IP
      quiz.py                   POST /api/quiz/answer (optional auth; validates against stored answer_index; first authed answer per question updates the unified knowledge score, own posts never scored, 60/min); GET /api/quiz/state/{post_id} (auth, answered questions with corrections); GET /api/users/{username}/elo (public, {global_rating, formats:{}})
      train.py                  POST /api/train/answer (auth, 120/min) — applies one Train marathon answer to the SAME users.knowledge_rating via apply_answer_timed; returns {rating, delta, global_rating}; mock phase trusts client-decided correctness (no server question bank yet)
      comments.py               GET /api/posts/{id}/comments?count=true → {count} or full list (CommentOut flattens user → username/is_verified/avatar_url); POST /api/posts/{id}/comments (auth, 30/5min); DELETE /api/comments/{id} (auth, own comment only); pending posts 404 for non-authors
      uploads.py                POST /api/upload/image (10/hr, validate_image, uploads to Supabase bucket "uploads", returns public URL); POST /api/upload/svg (10/hr, sanitize_svg, returns svg_content string inline — not stored)
      admin.py                  PATCH /api/admin/users/{user_id}/verify — sets is_verified=1; caller must have is_verified>0; 403 otherwise
      posts.py                  GET /api/posts/mine (auth, any status); POST /api/posts (auth, 20/day, status="published" if verified else "pending", sets is_user_content=True, sanitizes visual_svg fields, interest slugs validated in one IN query); GET /api/posts/{id} (pending visible to author only); _attach_counts() helper adds like_count+comment_count as Python attributes before Pydantic serialization
      chat.py                   GET /api/chat/conversations (auth, sorted by last activity, last-message preview); POST /api/chat/conversations (auth, 20/hr; body {usernames[], name?}; DM for 1 username with per-pair dedupe, group for 2-19; each target needs an accepted follow in either direction); GET /api/chat/conversations/{id}/messages?before_id&limit (auth, participant only, 404 otherwise); WS /api/chat/ws (first-frame JWT auth, see SECURITY)
      battle.py                 WS /api/battle/ws — 1v1 quiz duel relay; first-frame JWT auth like chat ({type:"auth",token}, account required); BattleManager (in-memory user_id->socket + user_id->opponent room, latest-socket-wins reconnect, single-process caveat like chat); {type:"challenge",username} looks up the active user (error if missing/self, opponent_unavailable if offline/busy) then pairs; progress/finish frames relayed to the paired opponent; battle_start carries a shared seed (clients derive the same question sequence locally, mock phase) + per-side opponent username for rematch; challenge rate-limited 30/min per user; reuses chat's wss-or-local-network gate (loopback + private LAN ranges allowed for plain ws so dev devices connect) + frame-size/JSON guards
      stats.py                  GET /api/stats/global (no auth, all platform analytics; response cached in-process for 60s — identical for every caller); GET /api/stats/me (auth, personal stats — my_streak/my_milestones/my_engagement_score/my_elo/my_quiz/posts_liked/my_likes_given_by_format computed server-side; posts_saved stays -1, counted client-side from localStorage); FORMATS includes all 7 formats incl. academy; date/time helpers are dialect-aware (to_char/extract on PostgreSQL, strftime on the SQLite test DB); raw SQL subqueries use explicit aliases and COUNT(*)/COUNT(col) in HAVING instead of aliases; post_quality_over_time uses one GROUP BY query (no per-month loop); round trips minimized for the remote DB: overview counts in one multi-subselect SELECT (both endpoints), ranking/max-engagement/first-like/first-comment scalars in one multi-subselect SELECT, streak dates derived in Python from the milestones query, per-format top creators in one grouped query, weekday/hour series derived in Python from the heatmap query, status counts grouped

    globals.css                 Tailwind import, Circuit design tokens (@theme: neutral black surface-0/1/2/3/overlay, neutral gray edge/edge-strong, neutral ink levels, lamp/like/good/bad/save accents, fmt-* format inks, radius-card/field for in-content blocks); neutral dot-grid body texture (body::before, no colored background glow); focus-visible lamp ring; Stage component vocabulary (.card = borderless frosted slab bg-white/4% + blur, .btn* = borderless pills with springy press scale, .btn-icon = frosted circle, .field = frosted fill with soft radius (single-line inputs add rounded-full at call site), .chip = frosted pill with neutral active fill, .label-caps/.prose-post unchanged); heart-pop + heart-boom + stage-pulse + stage-sheet-in keyframes with reduced-motion guards; ::highlight(read-aloud-sentence/-word) accent washes for read-aloud tracking
    page.tsx                    home feed: 11-tab bar (Following + For You + Train + Battle + 7 formats derived from lib/formats.ts; For You is the default open tab, so the pager instant-aligns to it on mount) rendered by FeedHeader, horizontal snap between tabs, vertical snap within each; the Train tab renders <Marathon onExit=back-to-ForYou/> and the Battle tab renders <Battle onExit=back-to-ForYou/> (each gated on activation: empty surface-0 page until first opened, so the marathon does not run and the battle socket does not connect early) instead of a card feed; swipe pager + real-time indicator via the shared useSwipeTabs hook (no color interpolation — accents live on the cards and switch hard on snap-settle); page keeps sessionStorage tab restore + tab-strip auto-centering; tabs read via useSWR cache-first (revalidateIfStale false — server jitters feed order, a background refetch would reshuffle visibly), so revisiting the feed renders instantly from cache; tab alignment: first tab snaps left, last tab snaps right, middle tabs center; Stage states per tab (stage-pulse slab loading, slab empty/login states); TabPage pb-24 clears the floating dock; BottomNav (feed active)
    onboarding/
      page.tsx                  server component — renders InterestPicker (no props)
      InterestPicker.tsx        client — fetches /api/interests, groups 148 frosted pills into 10 categories (chip-on neutral active fill), stage-pulse pill loading placeholders, sticky header/footer, saves slugs to localStorage
    login/
      page.tsx                  Stage sign-in: frosted back circle top-left (router.back()), Deepscroll label-caps + serif heading floating above the slab, form-only frosted slab (pill email + password fields, inline error, pill CTA), register link floating below; redirects to / on success or if already logged in
    register/
      page.tsx                  Stage register: same composition as login (back circle, floating heading, form-only slab with pill email + username + password fields, sign-in link below); redirects to / on success or if already logged in

      page.tsx                  account page in Stage slabs: Avatar with frosted camera-button upload (POST /api/auth/me/avatar), @username, email, "View public profile" link, knowledge score slab (global + per-format frosted chips from /api/users/{me}/elo), My posts / Saved posts slab rows, bio slab (160 chars), private account toggle (off = white/10% fill, on = lamp), follow requests panel with avatars (private accounts only, accept/decline each), inline forms for change username / change password / sign out / delete account; followers/following list opens a Stage floating sheet (inset rounded-3xl, stage-sheet-in); BottomNav (profile active)
      [username]/
        page.tsx                public profile: frosted back/settings circles, 72px Avatar (uploaded picture or initial), verified badge, bio, stats row (posts/followers/following/knowledge Elo); followers+following counts open a Stage floating sheet user list; follow/unfollow pill (optimistic update written into the SWR cache, revalidate false); own profile: Posts|Saved|Liked as a swipeable pager (useSwipeTabs + SegmentedTabs capsule with sliding indicator; Saved/Liked per-id fetches run on first tab settle, not on mount; pager wrapper height-clamps to the active page via ResizeObserver so short tabs don't inherit the tallest page's scroll length); foreign profile: posts list only — no switcher, no swipe, Saved/Liked are private and not shown; content scrolls in an inner div so dock and sheet stay pinned; profile/elo/posts via useSWR (/api/users/{username}/profile, /elo, /api/feed/user/{username}) — revisits render cached instantly with silent background refresh; BottomNav (profile active)
    search/
      page.tsx                  pill search input; one debounced (300ms) search fetches /api/search and /api/search/users in parallel; Posts|Accounts SegmentedTabs capsule appears once a query exists and switches (tap or swipe, useSwipeTabs 2-page pager) which fetched list shows; posts page: format chips (server-side filter, re-fires the search) + frosted slab result cards; accounts page: slab rows with Avatar, verified badge, bio and follow/unfollow pill; stage-pulse loading slabs; BottomNav (search active)

      page.tsx                  3-step creation wizard for all 7 formats in Stage: step 1 — 7 frosted format cards (selected = accent border + brighter fill); step 2 — duplicate check (slab result rows); step 3 — Books: full wizard with Feed Card block + 15 section accordion slabs (Required/Optional pill badges, 9 required / 6 optional); all other formats: format-specific feed card fields + body textarea (stored as heart section) + shared quiz + sources; inner list items and feed-card blocks = frosted rounded-2xl/3xl fills, interest pills neutral active fill; submits {format, title, feed_card, sections, interests} to POST /api/posts; on success invalidates the cached feed lists; /api/interests via useSWR (static list, cached across visits); slab login gate + success screen linking to /my-posts; BottomNav (create active)

      stage.tsx                  shared Train/Battle stage primitives ported from mobile stage.tsx: GlowCard (.card frosted slab + lamp radial-gradient glow overlay, the SlabGlow equivalent), MessageSlab (centered empty/error/login slab), LABEL_CAPS (mono uppercase tracked label, distinct from the sans .label-caps)
      NumberSlider.tsx           tactile numeric-answer slider (pointer drag/click on the track, pointer capture so dragging continues off-track): snaps to step, thumb swells while held, big live mono readout + min/max limit labels; result mode locks it and marks the correct value with a green tick (thumb tinted good/bad); web port of mobile NumberSlider (no haptics)
      Marathon.tsx               self-contained Train marathon (intro->question->feedback->question|summary), web port of mobile Marathon: GlowCard slabs, intro header ("Train" beside a lamp-tinted rating box) + blurred teaser question (blur-[3px]) with the Start button centered on top, mono top strip (rating + StreakStat flame brightening with streak), renderAnswerArea picks per kind (choice option pills with good/bad feedback coloring, or NumberSlider with a Submit button), ElapsedBar toward SLOW_MS (CSS width, motion-gated) + rating TickingNumber eloBefore->eloAfter + mono delta chip, motion gated on prefers-reduced-motion; guests play but rating not persisted (GuestNote -> /login), logged-in scoring server-side via trainApi; Primary/ghost buttons; optional onExit prop
      Battle.tsx                 self-contained Battle tab 1v1 duel (lobby->waiting->question<->feedback->done->summary; being challenged jumps to question), web port of mobile Battle: account-gated (login prompt for guests); lobby shows the user's following list (GET /api/users/{username}/following) under "Your friends" by default, switches to a debounced /api/search/users field when typing -> tappable user rows (Avatar + @username + VerifiedBadge + Battle pill) that challenge(username); uses useAuth + useBattleSocket; battle_start builds buildSequence(seed,count) shared with the opponent, both walk the same questions at their own pace, 1 point per correct, live You-vs-@opponent score strip; reuses GlowCard/NumberSlider; summary Win/Lose/Draw + Rematch + Back-to-feed (onExit); edge frames (opponent_left/unavailable/error) drop to lobby with a message
      PostCard.tsx               full-screen snap card in Stage: format marker above the slab (10px accent dot + accent lowercase mono label) over a borderless frosted slab (.card px-6 py-7) holding the format-aware content; exports SlabGlow (static per-card format-accent radial halo behind the slab — radial-gradient color-mix 8% → transparent 70%, clipped by the card's overflow-hidden so chrome stays neutral; hard color switch on snap because each card owns its glow); exports SlabAccent (3px accent bar on the slab's left edge + faint accent tint falling from the top edge, clipped into the rounded corners — edge accent, not a border or fill; also used by the detail header slab); kicker lines inside the slab (field/role/era_label) are accent label-caps; teasers as typography-only bullet rows directly on the slab (17px full-ink text + accent dots, mt-2 below the title layer, space-y rhythm — no panel, border or vertical line, never button-shaped); CardFooter inside the slab = Avatar (author_avatar_url) + @username + VerifiedBadge byline and neutral DotScale + "N min · extras" mono meta line; interest tags as two floating frosted pills bottom-left; read-aloud button (speaker glyph) sits at the right end of the format-marker row — the post block's top-right, not in the social rail; tap = requestAutoRead(post.id) + navigate, so the detail page opens already reading; action rail = bare glyphs right edge (like/comment/save/share, w-7 glyphs in w-11 tap targets, springy active:scale-90; items carry a fixed h-3 count slot — mono count inside, invisible when zero; the last item has no trailing slot — so button centers sit at one uniform interval; rail and interest tags bottom-anchor at safe-area + 72px, 4px above the nav dock top, bottoms aligned via flex-wrap-reverse on the tag container); re-exports Post type; format styles from lib/formats.ts; comment-count changes from the bottom sheet write through to the cached feed lists (updatePostInFeedCaches)
      BottomNav.tsx              Stage floating dock: frosted pill (h-14 rounded-full bg-white/6% blur) inset left-4/right-4 and 12px above the safe-area bottom; Chat / Stats / Feed / Create / Profile items built as a NavItem[] array with NAV_ICONS svg content (stats = line-chart glyph: axes + rising trend, replacing the signal-bar rects); active item = neutral filled circle (bg-white/12%), no glow; pages clear it with pb-24; prefetches the sibling routes on mount so the first tap skips the route-chunk download (incl. the ~517 KB recharts chunk for /stats)
      Providers.tsx              "use client" boundary; wraps children with AuthProvider + SWRConfig (jsonFetcher as default fetcher; focus/reconnect revalidation off to keep request patterns unchanged) so layout.tsx stays a Server Component
    lib/
      eventQueue.ts             module-level batch queue; flushes every 5s or at 5 events to POST /api/events with Authorization header when token present; exports hasPendingLike/cancelPendingLike so unlike-before-flush can cancel an in-flight event; deduplicates "like" events per post_id within the current queue
      auth.tsx                  AuthContext + AuthProvider: stores JWT in localStorage under "deepscroll_token", restores session via /api/auth/me on load, exposes user/login/register/logout/updateUser/loading; normalizes FastAPI string/array error details; clears the SWR cache on login/register/logout so no cached data crosses accounts
      api.ts                    apiFetch wrapper: prepends NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, attaches Authorization: Bearer header when token present; skips Content-Type for FormData bodies
      swr.ts                    SWR cache plumbing: jsonFetcher (apiFetch-backed, throws ApiError with status), clearApiCache() global wipe used by auth.tsx; updatePostInFeedCaches(postId, patch) patches a post in all cached /api/feed* lists (comment-count write-through), invalidateFeedCaches() drops them (called after post creation)
      relativeTime.ts           shared relativeTime(iso) formatter (just now / Nm / Nh / Nd / short date)
      useComments.ts            comment list state hook (fetch/post/delete, loadedRef count guard) shared by CommentsBottomSheet and the post detail page
      useSwipeTabs.ts           shared swipe-to-switch-tabs hook (extracted from the feed): horizontal scroll-snap pager + scroll-synced sliding indicator (left/width interpolated between index-keyed tab buttons), scrollend commit with 50ms debounce fallback, activatedIndices Set for lazy page mounting, selectTab click-to-scroll, ResizeObserver realigns scrollLeft on resize, refreshIndicator() re-measures when tab buttons mount late
      chatSocket.ts             useChatSocket hook: one ws per page, http→ws url derivation, first-frame JWT auth, auto-reconnect (3s), send(conversationId, body); exports ChatMessage/Conversation types + MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS
      battleSocket.ts           useBattleSocket(loggedIn, onEvent) hook modeled on chatSocket: one ws to /api/battle/ws (http→ws url derivation + localStorage token), first-frame JWT auth {type:"auth",token}, 3s reconnect, status open on "auth_ok"; senders challenge(username)/progress(index,correct,score)/finish(score); exports BattleInbound union type
      likedPosts.ts             isPostLiked, likePost, unlikePost, getLikedPostIds; localStorage key "deepscroll_liked"; getCachedLikeCount/setCachedLikeCount; key "deepscroll_like_counts"; isLikeSent/markLikeSent/unmarkLikeSent; key "deepscroll_like_sent" tracks posts whose like event reached the backend — used in the server-count reconciliation formula; one-time migration seeds sent-key from liked-key; server-safe; TODO: replace with backend endpoint
      savedPosts.ts             isPostSaved, savePost, unsavePost, getSavedPostIds; localStorage key "deepscroll_saved"; server-safe; TODO: replace with backend endpoint
  src/lib/
    readAloud/
      useReadAloud.ts           read-aloud hook, sentence queue with two engines: Piper neural TTS preferred (one WAV per sentence through a single reused <audio> element, two sentences pre-generated while current plays, sentence highlight only, silent-WAV unlock for iOS autoplay) with speechSynthesis fallback (pickVoice natural-voice pick, onboundary word highlight); session counter invalidates stale callbacks, status idle/loading/playing/paused, start/pause/resume/stop/toggle; unmount + pagehide silence audio so it never bleeds into the next page
      extractText.ts            walks visible Text nodes under a root (skips button/script/style/svg/aria-hidden/data-no-read/display:none), builds a combined string + node-offset segment map, block-tag boundaries force sentence breaks, regex sentence splitter (terminator+whitespace, keeps "3.14"/"e.g." intact)
      voice.ts                  pickVoice(lang): scores getVoices() for the most natural option (Edge neural "Natural" > Chrome "Google" network voices > local), exact-locale bonus; warmVoices() triggers Chrome's async voice-list load early; only used by the speechSynthesis fallback engine
      piper.ts                  loadPiper(): lazy singleton for the Piper neural TTS voice (@diffusionstudio/vits-web dep, dynamic import keeps it out of the main bundle); VITS model en_US-hfc_female-medium (~60 MB one-time download, OPFS-cached), inference in a worker, faster than realtime on plain CPU (Kokoro was tried first: too slow on WASM, static noise on WebGPU); resolves null on failure → speechSynthesis fallback
      nodeStub.ts               empty default export aliased to Node's fs in next.config.ts so vits-web's WASM glue (Node-only require("fs") branch) bundles for the browser
      highlights.ts             CSS Custom Highlight API painter: rangeFromOffsets maps combined-string offsets back to DOM Ranges via the segment map; read-aloud-sentence / read-aloud-word highlights (::highlight rules in globals.css); no-ops where unsupported
      autostart.ts              requestAutoRead/consumeAutoRead sessionStorage handoff so the feed card speaker tap starts reading after navigation to the detail page (consumed once, per post id)
    formats.ts                  single source of format identity: FORMAT_IDS, FORMAT_STYLES (label, badge, Circuit ink hex, rgb, text/dot/border/indicator classes from fmt-* tokens), formatStyle() with neutral fallback, LEGACY_SVG_ACCENT_MAP (old accent hex → new ink, used by SvgBlock)
    train/
      mockQuestions.ts          PLACEHOLDER pool of 24 broad general-knowledge MarathonQuestion objects (~8 per difficulty), mix of choice + kind:"numeric" slider questions; shared shape with mobile so a Battle seed derives the same sequence on either client; answerIndex/answerValue client-side (mock phase only)
      elo.ts                    marathon Elo math (adaptive difficulty + GUEST-ONLY local simulation), ported verbatim from mobile: START_ELO/ELO_FLOOR/K_FAST/K_SLOW/DIFFICULTY_RATING/FAST_MS/SLOW_MS/TIME_BONUS_MAX + expectedScore/kFactor/timeFactor/computeDelta/applyDelta/pickDifficulty; logged-in scoring is server-side
      trainApi.ts               the seam: question selection still mock (fetchNextQuestion: pickDifficulty bucket then random unseen, nearest-rating fallback); submitAnswer({loggedIn, chosenIndex|chosenValue}) decides correctness per kind, POSTs /api/train/answer for logged-in players (authoritative rating/delta), falls back to local computeDelta for guests; shapes AnswerResult
    battle/
      seededQuestions.ts        buildSequence(seed, count): mulberry32 PRNG + Fisher-Yates seeded shuffle of mockQuestions sliced to count; same seed -> identical sequence on every client (mock phase), identical math to the mobile version
  src/types/
    train.ts                    Difficulty (1|2|3 -> 800/1000/1200) + MarathonQuestion union (ChoiceQuestion {options,answerIndex} | NumericQuestion kind:"numeric" {answerValue,min,max,step?,unit?}) + AnswerResult; top note: answer client-side only for mock phase, must move server-side
  src/components/
    SvgBlock.tsx                shared visual_svg renderer; user content → UTF-8-safe base64 <img>, seed → dangerouslySetInnerHTML; render-time re-palette of legacy accent hexes to Circuit inks; className/color props for per-section layout
    SectionLabel.tsx            unified section header (h3, text-xs uppercase tracking-widest, zinc-500 default, color override); data-no-read keeps labels out of read-aloud
    VerifiedBadge.tsx           level-based user check (1=slate-blue, 2=gold, 3+=purple) + variant="official" for Deepscroll seed content; size prop
    Spinner.tsx                 unified loading spinner (sm/md)
    PostRow.tsx                 compact post list slab (format dot + badge + title, hover brightens fill) used by profile tabs
    SectionRenderer.tsx         maps section.type → component; handles all sections for books/facts/people/concepts/questions/stories formats; NO_READ_SECTIONS (at_a_glance/quiz/quiz_badge/paper_card/related_posts/sources) wrapped in data-no-read so read-aloud speaks only prose sections

mobile/                         React Native app (Expo SDK 56, TypeScript, expo-router, NativeWind 4 + tailwindcss 3.4); phase 5 = profiles, follows, search and stats in Stage; chat = live DMs and groups over the websocket

  src/components/PostCard.tsx   memoized full-screen Stage card; per-format layouts (books/people/facts/concepts/questions/stories/academy + fallback) mirroring web PostCard; format marker row (accent dot + lowercase mono label + disabled read-aloud speaker) above a borderless frosted slab (white/4% radius 24) with SlabAccent + SlabGlow halo behind; accent teaser dots + 17px ink teasers; CardFooter avatar byline + neutral DotScale + "N min" mono meta (reading time + difficulty only); no visible action buttons in the feed (like/comment/save/share moved to the post detail bar); tap -> /post/{id}, double-tap (300ms) -> like with reanimated heart-boom overlay, gesture-handler Pan swipe-left-to-open (translationX<-80 && >|dy|, activeOffsetX -40 so vertical paging/taps untouched) mirroring the detail's swipe-right-to-close; via usePostActions
  src/components/train/Marathon.tsx  self-contained Train marathon (intro->question->feedback->question|summary): frosted Stage slabs + SlabGlow, intro header ("Train" title beside a highlighted lamp-tinted rating container, top-right) then a blurred teaser question (PREVIEW_QUESTION in a BlurTargetView + BlurView blurMethod dimezisBlurView on Android / backdrop blur on iOS) with the Start button centered on top, mono top strip (rating/StreakStat flame brightens with streak + resets on wrong/answered), Newsreader prompt, renderAnswerArea picks per kind: spring-animated OptionRow (choice) shared by question+feedback (press spring + correct-reveal pop; QuizSection good/bad coloring) or NumberSlider (numeric, with a Submit button while answering), elapsed-time ElapsedBar toward SLOW_MS (visual only), rating TickingNumber eloBefore->eloAfter ~500ms + Geist Mono delta chip, expo-haptics success/warning, all motion gated on reduced-motion (instant fallback), token-only colors, PrimaryButton Start/Next/Train again + ghostPill Back-to-feed, guests play but rating not persisted (GuestNote -> /login), trainStorage persistence, PulsingSlab loading only until first question loads (kept on screen through submit/next so the card never flashes to the dark background) + MessageSlab friendly exhausted-pool/error ghost-retry, full-height ScrollView (safe-area top pad clears FeedTabBar, pb-24 clears dock); seam summarised in top comment; optional onExit prop
  src/components/battle/Battle.tsx  self-contained Battle tab 1v1 duel (lobby->waiting->question<->feedback->done->summary; being challenged jumps to question): account-gated (login prompt for guests); lobby shows the user's following list (GET /api/users/{username}/following, loaded on mount) under a "Your friends" label as tappable rows by default, and switches to a debounced /api/search/users field when a query is typed -> tappable user rows (Avatar + @username + VerifiedBadge + Battle pill) that challenge(username); uses useAuth + useBattleSocket; battle_start builds buildSequence(seed,count) shared with the opponent; both walk the same questions at their own pace, 1 point per correct, live You-vs-@opponent score strip; reuses Train's NumberSlider + frosted Stage slabs/SlabGlow/PrimaryButton/tokens; choice option pills replicate Train's good/bad feedback coloring; expo-haptics on answer; summary Win/Lose/Draw + Rematch (re-challenge same opponent) + Back-to-feed (onExit); edge frames (opponent_left/unavailable/error) drop to lobby with a message; full-height ScrollView (safe-area top pad clears FeedTabBar)
  src/components/SafeSvg.tsx    SvgBlock counterpart: seed -> inline SvgXml with legacy-hex re-palette; user content -> expo-image with svg+xml data URI (no script execution); optional color prop for currentColor strokes
  src/components/SectionRenderer.tsx  port of web SectionRenderer: sorts by order, dispatches all 80 section types, isUserContent to SVG sections, postId to QuizSection; divide-y becomes per-section borderTop
  src/components/sections/      80 section ports mirroring frontend sections/ 1:1; primitives.tsx supplies SectionBlock (px-6 py-8), SectionLabel (.label-caps), Prose (.prose-post 17/29 serif), sans/mono style builders, SvgFigure (viewBox aspect parse + SafeSvg + max-width), CaptionedImage (resolveImageUrl), makeLabeledProse factory (the ~30 label+paragraph sections are one-liners), NumberBubble
  src/components/sections/QuizSection.tsx  quiz port: POST /api/quiz/answer, good/bad option coloring + explanation + Elo delta chip, state restore via GET /api/quiz/state, summary card, login hint
  src/components/CommentsBottomSheet.tsx  Stage floating sheet port: detached 12px inset card (radius 24, surface-1/95) with reanimated spring-in (translateY 48 + scale 0.97, overshoot bezier), backdrop, drag handle (up=75%, down=50%/close), bubble comment rows (28px avatar + surface-2 bubble, delete own inline), pill input + circular arrow-up submit (no statusBarTranslucent so Android adjustResize keeps input above keyboard)
  src/components/VerifiedBadge.tsx  react-native-svg port of web VerifiedBadge (level colors + official variant)
  src/components/MathText.tsx   $...$ parser port; math segments render as Geist Mono text (no KaTeX/HTML in RN - known fidelity gap for academy/formalism)
  src/components/icons.tsx      Stage glyph set (heart/comment/bookmark/share/arrow-up/speaker/back/flame), path data copied from web icons.tsx: strokeWidth 1.8 soft outlines, filled prop turns closed shapes solid; FlameIcon is the marathon streak glyph
  src/components/stage.tsx      Stage primitives: SlabGlow (Svg radial accent halo, 8% -> transparent 70%), SlabAccent (3px left bar + 48px top tint), Frosted (BlurView chrome pill — translucent fallback on Android), PulsingSlab (stage-pulse loading), MessageSlab + ghostPillStyle for slab states
  src/components/PrimaryButton.tsx  web Stage .btn-primary recipe (flat lamp-tinted pill) as Pressable; label/onPress/disabled; plain object style — nativewind's css-interop drops Pressable style callback functions (issue #1105), so phase-5 components never use them (pre-phase-5 files still do and lose their pressed/layout styles)
  src/components/FeedTab.tsx    one pager page: lazy fetch on first activation (GET /api/feed?interests&format; Following -> /api/feed/following with login/empty states); posts reset on user change; vertical paging FlatList from phase 1; Stage states (pulsing-slab loading, MessageSlab empty/login/error, ghost-pill retry)
  src/components/FeedTabBar.tsx Stage floating frosted capsule (h-44 pill, detached at safe-area+12) + separate frosted search circle (icon centered via Svg viewBox, fills circle); neutral white/10% indicator pill slides behind labels (reanimated translateX+width over measured tab bounds from PagerView onPageScroll — no color interpolation); labels reserve constant width via invisible semibold copy so active-state weight swap never reflows the pill; accent only as 6px dot on the active tab; auto-centers active tab (clamped)
  src/components/BottomNav.tsx  Stage floating dock port: frosted pill (h-56) inset left/right 16 and 12px above the safe-area bottom; active prop ("feed"|"stats"|"profile"|"chat"|"create") = neutral white/12% circle, no glow; Stats -> /stats, Feed -> /, Profile -> own public profile or /login, Chat -> /chat, Create -> /create; onComingSoon prop now optional/unused (kept for call-site compatibility)
  src/components/Toast.tsx      useToast hook + frosted white/10% pill above the nav dock; 1800ms auto-hide, reanimated FadeIn/FadeOut
  src/components/Avatar.tsx     web Avatar port: expo-image circle or surface-3 serif-initial fallback, /uploads/ paths get BASE_URL prepended; verified ring = wrapper border (2px color + 2px surface-0 gap) instead of box-shadow
  src/components/PostRow.tsx    web PostRow port: compact slab row (format dot + caps badge + 2-line serif title) -> /post/{id}; used by profile tabs
  src/components/SegmentedTabs.tsx  web SegmentedTabs port: equal-width frosted capsule (h-44, p-4) with sliding white/12% indicator; closed-form math from measured width; optional progress SharedValue from a PagerView, else internal 200ms tween on activeIndex
  src/components/UserListSheet.tsx  followers/following Stage floating sheet: CommentsBottomSheet shell (12px-inset Frosted card, stage-sheet-in spring) minus drag handle/input; FlatList of Avatar 40 rows -> /profile/{username}; users=null renders pulsing slabs; exports ListUser
  src/components/stats/chartTheme.ts  Stage chart constants port (AXIS #8a8a8a/11, GRID, RANK_COLORS, FORMAT_COLORS, heatmap ramps, gauge track) + niceMax axis helper; no tooltip constants (no hover on mobile)
  src/components/stats/types.ts  GlobalStats/MyStats/FriendStats interfaces copied verbatim from web stats page
  src/components/stats/charts.tsx  react-native-svg chart kit replacing recharts: HBarChart (inline value labels), VBarChart (angled option), GroupedVBarChart, LineChart, DualLineChart (per-series scaling = web dual axes, tinted ticks), AreaChart (gradient fill, cumulative option), PieChart (donut via innerRatio, legend), RadarChart (multi-series), ScatterChart, TreemapChart (inline squarify); all take explicit pixel width from the route, static (no tooltips)
  src/components/stats/widgets.tsx  web custom component ports: WaffleChart (10x10 View grid), CalendarHeatmap (12-month grid), ActivityHeatmap (7x24, fit-to-width instead of horizontal scroll), GaugeChart (Svg arc + needle, near 1:1), StatCard/StatCardGrid, DataTable (flex rows), ProgressBarList, FormatChip
  src/components/stats/CategorySection.tsx  web CategorySection port: frosted slab + caps label + neutral selector pills; charts are render thunks (only the selected chart mounts) and the pill row wraps instead of scrolling (no horizontal scrollable inside the PagerView)
  src/components/stats/GlobalTab.tsx  web GlobalTab port: the same 19 categories/chart options (overview cards, creator rankings, top posts, over-time series incl. calendar/cumulative/overlay, by-format incl. treemap/waffle/radar, weekday/hour activity, quality, status donut/gauge, commenters) as a chunked FlatList of CategorySections
  src/components/stats/MyStatsTab.tsx  web MyStatsTab port: 17 categories (overview, knowledge score progress bars, over-time, activity, formats, read time, top posts, ranking/engagement gauges, streak cards with flame glyph instead of the web emoji, milestones as a wrapping grid, likes given, scroll behavior)
  src/components/stats/FriendsTab.tsx  web FriendsTab port: self-contained fan-out (GET /following then per-friend /elo + /profile, cap 12, per-friend try/catch, cancellation flag), no-friends empty state -> /search, 8 comparison sections (overview, Elo leaderboard, per-format Elo radar/grouped/leaders, quiz activity, efficiency, breadth grid/donut, content, social)

### user_elo (DEPRECATED)
Legacy per-format Elo table, replaced by the single users.knowledge_rating column.

backfilled into users.knowledge_rating by scripts/add_knowledge_columns.py. Safe to

```

## ELO KNOWLEDGE SCORE

A user has ONE unified knowledge score (users.knowledge_rating) — the profile "Knowledge score"
and the Train tab Elo are the same number. Standard Elo: R' = R + K * (S - E),
E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Q - R) / 400)). Each question is an opponent rated by difficulty
(1→800, 2→1000, 3→1200; default 1000). Correct answers gain points, wrong answers always lose
points so guessing has a cost. K=32 for the first 30 scored answers (fast convergence), K=16
after (stable). Rating starts at 1000 (NULL until the first answer), floored at 100. Two writers:
POST /api/quiz/answer (post quizzes; each question scores once per user via DB unique constraint,
own posts never move the rating; answer_index/explanation stripped from payloads, correctness
decided server-side) and POST /api/train/answer (Train marathon; adds a speed bonus on correct
answers; mock phase trusts client correctness until a server question bank exists). The legacy
per-format user_elo table is deprecated; backfilled into users.knowledge_rating as the average of
each user's per-format ratings.

## CHAT / WEBSOCKET DESIGN

One socket per client at WS /api/chat/ws serves all of that user's conversations; the server
routes by participant lookup, the client never subscribes to anything. Auth is a first frame
{type:"auth", token} validated with the existing JWT decode + is_active check (token stays out
of URLs and logs; browsers cannot set WS headers). Plain ws:// is refused (4403) unless the
client is on a loopback/private-LAN address (RFC1918/link-local — so dev devices like the Android
emulator or a phone on the LAN can connect) or x-forwarded-proto says https — production over
public IPs must run wss behind TLS. Sending
goes through the socket only ({type:"send"}); persistence happens before broadcast, and the
sender's echo doubles as the delivery confirmation. Participant-only authorization is re-checked
in the DB on every send and every REST call; non-participants get 404/error indistinguishable
from nonexistent conversations. Conversation creation requires an accepted follow in either
direction with every target (so private accounts are unreachable until they approve). DMs are
deduplicated per user pair; groups hold 2-19 targets + creator. Messages: plain text 1-2000
chars, 30/min per user; no E2E encryption by design (would split DM/group into two systems and
break moderation). ConnectionManager and rate limits are in-process — fine single-worker,
needs Redis pub/sub for multi-worker. Deliberate scope cuts: no read receipts, no typing
indicators, no message deletion, conversation list does not live-update (refetch on open).

## SECURITY

See SECURITY_REVIEW.md (June 2026) for the full audit: what was fixed vs accepted vs open decisions.

Comment body is untrusted user input stored as plain text. React's default JSX text rendering
writes to the DOM via `.textContent`, which the browser treats as literal characters — `<script>`
becomes `&lt;script&gt;` and cannot execute. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` bypasses this by injecting
raw HTML directly into the DOM, enabling XSS if the string contains `<script>` tags or event
attributes. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render comment text.

### User-uploaded file security

- **SVG sanitized twice**: upload endpoint (sanitize_svg) + post creation (sanitize_svg_text) as defense-in-depth
- **SVG rendering**: user SVGs (is_user_content=true) rendered as `<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,…">` — JavaScript cannot execute in image context. Official/seed SVGs may use dangerouslySetInnerHTML (controlled pipeline); marked with a comment in PostCard.tsx and post/[id]/page.tsx
- **Image re-encoding**: Pillow converts to RGB and re-saves at quality=85, stripping steganographic payloads and ICC profiles
- **Magic-byte check**: file bytes inspected before Pillow to reject non-image content disguised with an image extension
- **Animated GIFs**: rejected outright (hard to sanitize safely)
- **UUID filenames**: upload filenames always UUID-generated — user-provided filenames are never used (prevents path traversal like `../../etc/passwd`)
- **Upload directory**: absolute path outside backend/ (`user_uploads/` at repo root) — files are never on Python's module search path
- **image_url validation**: user-submitted posts must use the Supabase storage URL prefix (`{SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/uploads/`) — no arbitrary external image URLs accepted
- **File size enforced via chunked reads**: Content-Length header is not trusted; reads stop as soon as the running total exceeds the limit
- **Rate limits**: 10 image uploads/hr, 10 SVG uploads/hr, 20 post submissions/day per user (in-memory, no external dependency)

## CURRENT STATUS

**Built**
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL (Supabase), CORS, full API
- Section-based post schema: feed_card JSON + sections JSON array; old per-format fields removed
- 15 section types for Books format (validated via Pydantic v2 discriminated union)
- Seed script: 148 interests + auto-discovers all *_example.json files (currently Books + Facts + People); persists top-level tags + connections (default []) from each example; FORMAT_INTEREST_SLUGS maps format → interests; _post_title falls back to feed_card.name for People
- Legacy DB preserved as backend/deepscroll.db.legacy_*
- Onboarding: interest picker → slugs saved to localStorage → gates feed
- Feed: 9-tab horizontal swipe (For You + Following + 7 formats) + vertical snap scroll per tab
- Quiz + Elo: interactive quizzes, server-validated answers, per-format + global knowledge score (see ELO KNOWLEDGE SCORE)
- Profiles: avatar upload, knowledge score, follower/following lists, account search, follow UI end-to-end
- EmptyState component for format tabs with no posts yet
- Books feed card: cover, title, author, essence, 3 teasers, difficulty DotScale, year/genre
- Detail page: SectionRenderer renders 34 section types (15 Books + 10 Facts + 9 People) in order (SVG security: dangerouslySetInnerHTML for seed, base64 img for user)
- Create page: 3-step Books wizard with Feed Card block + interest picker (1–5) + 15 section accordions
- My-posts page: cover thumbnail + title + author + status from feed_card
- User accounts: JWT auth, register/login, follow system, public profiles, comments, likes, saves
- Stats page, verification system, saved posts
- Real-time chat: DMs + group chats over WebSocket (see CHAT / WEBSOCKET DESIGN), conversation list + chat view, chat in bottom nav (search moved top-right)
- Security hardening pass (June 2026, see SECURITY_REVIEW.md)
- "Stage" visual identity (June 2026, see docs/DESIGN.md): single design consolidated from the three-way exploration; Circuit neutral tokens in globals.css unchanged, component vocabulary redefined as borderless frosted slabs + detached pill chrome + springy press feedback; accents only on small post-owned elements (format dot, teaser bullets, tab dot, in-body --accent), hard accent switch on snap-settle in mixed feeds; per-post --accent CSS variable replaces hardcoded section colors; seed SVGs re-paletted at render time in SvgBlock (content JSON untouched); shared component vocabulary (.card/.btn/.btn-icon/.field/.chip/.label-caps)
- Read-aloud (June 2026): card speaker button opens the detail page reading aloud with sentence accent highlight + pause/resume/stop transport; voice = Piper neural TTS in-browser (vits-web, ~60 MB one-time model download, loading = pulsing transport button) with speechSynthesis fallback (natural-voice pick + word highlight); speaks title + prose only, chrome and metadata skipped via data-no-read (src/lib/readAloud/); RN app will need a different engine later (expo-speech), the sentence-queue/extraction layer is engine-agnostic

- Mobile app phase 1 (mobile/): Expo/React Native For You feed with TikTok-style vertical paging, Circuit tokens + web fonts, all 7 format card layouts
- Mobile app phase 2 (mobile/): JWT auth (SecureStore) with login/register screens + session restore, onboarding interest picker (AsyncStorage gate), 9-tab feed via PagerView with animated tab indicator, BottomNav + toast for unbuilt destinations
- Mobile app phase 3 (mobile/): post detail screen with all 80 section types (sections/ ports + AccentContext for per-post accent), seed-vs-user SVG security preserved in SafeSvg, quiz answering with Elo correction UI, like/save/comment/share on card rail + detail bar (eventQueue batching, CommentsBottomSheet, RN Share)
- Mobile app phase 4 (mobile/): Stage restyle of the feed, post detail and interactions (frosted slabs + floating pill chrome + per-post format glow + neutral indicators, web tab order with For You default); expo-blur chrome renders a translucent fallback + dark scrim on Android (real blur iOS-only); slabs/glows are plain fills + Svg radial gradients for FlatList smoothness; login/register/onboarding still Lamplight
- Mobile app phase 5 (mobile/): profiles (own settings page + public profile with follow/unfollow and Posts/Saved/Liked tabs), follows (user-list sheet, follow requests), search (posts + accounts, format chips) and stats (Global/Personal/Friends with a custom react-native-svg chart kit replacing recharts), all in Stage; avatar upload via expo-image-picker

**Next**
- Content for academy format
- Recommendation algorithm improvements
- Pagination / infinite scroll
