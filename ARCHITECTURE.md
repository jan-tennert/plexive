# Deepscroll Architecture

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

```
backend/
  requirements.txt              fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, passlib[bcrypt], python-jose[cryptography], python-dotenv, email-validator, supabase
  .env.example                  JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY templates (copy to .env, never commit .env)
  seed.py                       idempotent: get-or-create 145 interests from taxonomy; reads SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD from backend/.env; get-or-create @Marlo (marlo07drews@gmail.com, is_verified=2); auto-discovers all *_example.json files in docs/content-structure/examples/ — upserts one post per file (format derived from filename, title from feed_card.title|concept_name|the_question|headline|name); upsert key is (author_id, format) so title changes do not create duplicates; FORMAT_INTEREST_SLUGS dict maps format → interest slugs (books/facts/people/concepts/questions/stories defined)
  tests/_throwaway_db.py        sets DATABASE_URL to a temp SQLite file + blanks SUPABASE env BEFORE app import; every test file imports it first so suites can never touch the real DB or storage
  tests/smoke_test.py           end-to-end API smoke test (quiz/Elo, avatar via fake Supabase storage client, user search) against a throwaway SQLite DB (via _throwaway_db); run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\smoke_test.py (needs httpx)
  tests/chat_test.py            end-to-end chat test (conversation rules, history authz, websocket auth/send/broadcast/rejection) against a throwaway SQLite DB (via _throwaway_db); run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\chat_test.py
  tests/security_test.py        regression test for the June 2026 security review fixes; throwaway SQLite DB via _throwaway_db; run with .venv\Scripts\python.exe tests\security_test.py
  scripts/cleanup_smoke_test_data.sql  one-time manual cleanup of smoke-test rows accidentally written to the live DB on 2026-06-11 (run by hand, never from the app)
  scripts/add_indexes.py        one-time manual CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS for the live DB (events post_id+event_type/user_id/created_at, comments post_id, follows following_id+status); names match models.py; idempotent; run by hand, never from the app
  tests/perf_probe.py           endpoint timing probe against a running backend (--out saves timings + bodies for before/after comparison); authed endpoints via seed-admin login, token cached to respect rate limits
  tests/_db_inspect.py          legacy SQLite helper (no longer used; DB is Supabase PostgreSQL)
  app/
    database.py                 engine (PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL env var; pool_recycle=1200 + connect_timeout=10 on PG only — pool_pre_ping measured and rejected, +1 round trip per request), SessionLocal, Base, get_db dependency
    main.py                     FastAPI app, CORS origins from FRONTEND_ORIGIN env (default localhost:3000, "*" stripped), 10 MB request body cap middleware, router registration, create_all on startup; no StaticFiles mount (files served from Supabase Storage)
    models.py                   ORM models: Interest, Post (feed_card JSON not null, sections JSON not null, is_user_content Boolean not null default False, author_id FK→users nullable; indexes on format/status/created_at; author_username, author_is_verified and author_avatar_url as properties), Event (user_id nullable FK; indexes: (post_id,event_type) composite, user_id, created_at — apply to the live DB once via scripts/add_indexes.py), User (posts relationship, is_verified Integer default 0, is_private boolean default false, bio string nullable, avatar_url string nullable), Follow (follower_id FK→users, following_id FK→users, status "pending"|"accepted", created_at; UniqueConstraint uq_follow), UserElo (user_id+format unique, rating float, answered_count), QuizAnswer (user_id+post_id+question_index unique, chosen_index, is_correct, rating_delta), Comment, post_interests join table
    elo.py                      Elo knowledge score: start 1000, floor 100, K=32 first 30 answers per format then 16, question rating 800/1000/1200 from post_difficulty; elo_summary() returns global (average of per-format ratings, None until first answer) + per-format ratings in one query
    auth.py                     hash_password, verify_password, create_access_token, decode_access_token, get_current_user, get_optional_user (returns User|None, used for optional auth)
    schemas.py                  Pydantic v2 models: 15 section types with Literal discriminator → AnySection union; BooksFeedCard; PostCreate (Books required sections: essence/quiz_badge/voices/at_a_glance/heart/core_ideas/takeaway/quiz/sources; image_url recursive check for Supabase storage URL prefix); PostOut (feed_card dict, sections list[dict], is_user_content bool, like_count int, comment_count int; strips answer_index+explanation from quiz sections so answers never reach the client); PostListOut (PostOut subclass for list endpoints: serializes sections as [] — no list view renders sections, detail page refetches GET /api/posts/{id}); UserOut (incl. avatar_url), InterestOut, EventIn, UploadResponse, SvgUploadResponse
    sanitize.py                 validate_image() — sync (runs in threadpool via sync def endpoints; reads file.file), chunked read, magic-byte check, animated-GIF reject, Pillow re-encode; sanitize_svg() / sanitize_svg_text() — defusedxml XXE check, lxml element+attribute whitelist, dangerous-pattern rejection
    upload_config.py            Supabase client (SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY from env), SUPABASE_BUCKET="uploads", size limits (5 MB images, 512 KB SVGs)
    rate_limit.py               in-memory per-user rate limiter (dict of timestamps); check_rate_limit(user_id, key, max, window_secs); identity may also be a string ("ip:...", "email:...") for unauthenticated endpoints; idle buckets swept every 10 min (snapshot iteration, pop-with-default) so memory stays bounded
    post_counts.py              attach_counts(posts, db) / attach_counts_one(post, db) — batched like_count+comment_count attachment shared by posts/feed/search routers
    scoring.py                    score_posts() — interest match (tier-scaled), format engagement, repeat penalty; engagement read as one joined tuple query (events x post format, last 30 days)
    routers/
      interests.py              GET /api/interests
      feed.py                   GET /api/feed — three-tier: direct matches → related co-tags → all remaining; GET /api/feed/following (auth, posts from followed users, limit 50); GET /api/feed/user/{username} (no auth, published posts by user, limit 50); all three respond with PostListOut (sections serialized as [])

      events.py                 POST /api/events (captures user_id when auth token present; deduplicates "like" events per user+post for auth users via one IN query per batch, also within a batch; max 50 events/batch; unknown post ids dropped); GET /api/posts/{id}/likes → {count, liked} in one COUNT+MAX(CASE) query when authed; pending posts 404 for non-authors
      auth.py                   POST /api/auth/register (10/hr per IP; username must match ^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{3,30}$ — forward-only), POST /api/auth/login (10/5min per email + 30/5min per IP), GET /api/auth/me, PATCH /api/auth/me (update username/password/is_private/bio; same username rule), POST /api/auth/me/avatar (multipart, validate_image pipeline, 10/hr), DELETE /api/auth/me (soft delete: sets is_active=False)
      follows.py                POST /api/users/{username}/follow (60/hr); DELETE /api/users/{username}/follow; POST /api/users/{username}/follow/accept; DELETE /api/users/{username}/follow/reject; GET /api/users/{username}/followers; GET /api/users/{username}/following (private lists visible to owner + accepted followers); GET /api/users/{username}/follow-requests (auth, own only); GET /api/users/{username}/profile (no auth, returns counts + follow_status; follower/following/post counts in one multi-subselect SELECT); all user payloads include avatar_url
      search.py                 GET /api/search — Python-side search across post.title, feed_card.essence, feed_card.author, heart section content, core_ideas title+body (matching reads ORM sections pre-serialization; response is PostListOut with sections []); ranked by title-match then recency; limit 50; GET /api/search/users — username substring search, prefix matches first, limit 20, follow_status per row when authed; both: q max 100 chars, 60/min per user or IP
      quiz.py                   POST /api/quiz/answer (optional auth; validates against stored answer_index; first authed answer per question updates Elo, own posts never scored, 60/min); GET /api/quiz/state/{post_id} (auth, answered questions with corrections); GET /api/users/{username}/elo (public, global + per-format ratings)
      comments.py               GET /api/posts/{id}/comments?count=true → {count} or full list (CommentOut flattens user → username/is_verified/avatar_url); POST /api/posts/{id}/comments (auth, 30/5min); DELETE /api/comments/{id} (auth, own comment only); pending posts 404 for non-authors
      uploads.py                POST /api/upload/image (10/hr, validate_image, uploads to Supabase bucket "uploads", returns public URL); POST /api/upload/svg (10/hr, sanitize_svg, returns svg_content string inline — not stored)
      admin.py                  PATCH /api/admin/users/{user_id}/verify — sets is_verified=1; caller must have is_verified>0; 403 otherwise
      posts.py                  GET /api/posts/mine (auth, any status); POST /api/posts (auth, 20/day, status="published" if verified else "pending", sets is_user_content=True, sanitizes visual_svg fields, interest slugs validated in one IN query); GET /api/posts/{id} (pending visible to author only); _attach_counts() helper adds like_count+comment_count as Python attributes before Pydantic serialization
      chat.py                   GET /api/chat/conversations (auth, sorted by last activity, last-message preview); POST /api/chat/conversations (auth, 20/hr; body {usernames[], name?}; DM for 1 username with per-pair dedupe, group for 2-19; each target needs an accepted follow in either direction); GET /api/chat/conversations/{id}/messages?before_id&limit (auth, participant only, 404 otherwise); WS /api/chat/ws (first-frame JWT auth, see SECURITY)
      stats.py                  GET /api/stats/global (no auth, all platform analytics; response cached in-process for 60s — identical for every caller); GET /api/stats/me (auth, personal stats — my_streak/my_milestones/my_engagement_score/my_elo/my_quiz/posts_liked/my_likes_given_by_format computed server-side; posts_saved stays -1, counted client-side from localStorage); FORMATS includes all 7 formats incl. academy; date/time helpers are dialect-aware (to_char/extract on PostgreSQL, strftime on the SQLite test DB); raw SQL subqueries use explicit aliases and COUNT(*)/COUNT(col) in HAVING instead of aliases; post_quality_over_time uses one GROUP BY query (no per-month loop); round trips minimized for the remote DB: overview counts in one multi-subselect SELECT (both endpoints), ranking/max-engagement/first-like/first-comment scalars in one multi-subselect SELECT, streak dates derived in Python from the milestones query, per-format top creators in one grouped query, weekday/hour series derived in Python from the heatmap query, status counts grouped

  next.config.ts                devIndicators disabled (the floating dev badge covered the comment send button at phone width)
  .env.example                  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL template

  src/app/
    layout.tsx                  root layout, app fonts (Newsreader serif + Source Sans 3 UI + Geist Mono data), title "Deepscroll"
    globals.css                 Tailwind import, Circuit design tokens (@theme: neutral black surface-0/1/2/3/overlay, neutral gray edge/edge-strong, neutral ink levels, lamp/like/good/bad/save accents, fmt-* format inks, radius-card/field for in-content blocks); neutral dot-grid body texture (body::before, no colored background glow); focus-visible lamp ring; Stage component vocabulary (.card = borderless frosted slab bg-white/4% + blur, .btn* = borderless pills with springy press scale, .btn-icon = frosted circle, .field = frosted fill with soft radius (single-line inputs add rounded-full at call site), .chip = frosted pill with neutral active fill, .label-caps/.prose-post unchanged); heart-pop + heart-boom + stage-pulse + stage-sheet-in keyframes with reduced-motion guards
    page.tsx                    home feed: 9-tab bar (Following + For You + 7 formats derived from lib/formats.ts; For You is the default open tab, so the pager instant-aligns to it on mount) rendered by FeedHeader, horizontal snap between tabs, vertical snap within each; swipe pager + real-time indicator via the shared useSwipeTabs hook (no color interpolation — accents live on the cards and switch hard on snap-settle); page keeps sessionStorage tab restore + tab-strip auto-centering; tabs read via useSWR cache-first (revalidateIfStale false — server jitters feed order, a background refetch would reshuffle visibly), so revisiting the feed renders instantly from cache; tab alignment: first tab snaps left, last tab snaps right, middle tabs center; Stage states per tab (stage-pulse slab loading, slab empty/login states); TabPage pb-24 clears the floating dock; BottomNav (feed active)
    onboarding/
      page.tsx                  server component — renders InterestPicker (no props)
      InterestPicker.tsx        client — fetches /api/interests, groups 145 frosted pills into 10 categories (chip-on neutral active fill), stage-pulse pill loading placeholders, sticky header/footer, saves slugs to localStorage
    login/
      page.tsx                  Stage sign-in: frosted back circle top-left (router.back()), Deepscroll label-caps + serif heading floating above the slab, form-only frosted slab (pill email + password fields, inline error, pill CTA), register link floating below; redirects to / on success or if already logged in
    register/
      page.tsx                  Stage register: same composition as login (back circle, floating heading, form-only slab with pill email + username + password fields, sign-in link below); redirects to / on success or if already logged in
    profile/
      page.tsx                  account page in Stage slabs: Avatar with frosted camera-button upload (POST /api/auth/me/avatar), @username, email, "View public profile" link, knowledge score slab (global + per-format frosted chips from /api/users/{me}/elo), My posts / Saved posts slab rows, bio slab (160 chars), private account toggle (off = white/10% fill, on = lamp), follow requests panel with avatars (private accounts only, accept/decline each), inline forms for change username / change password / sign out / delete account; followers/following list opens a Stage floating sheet (inset rounded-3xl, stage-sheet-in); BottomNav (profile active)
      [username]/
        page.tsx                public profile: frosted back/settings circles, 72px Avatar (uploaded picture or initial), verified badge, bio, stats row (posts/followers/following/knowledge Elo); followers+following counts open a Stage floating sheet user list; follow/unfollow pill (optimistic update written into the SWR cache, revalidate false); own profile: Posts|Saved|Liked as a swipeable pager (useSwipeTabs + SegmentedTabs capsule with sliding indicator; Saved/Liked per-id fetches run on first tab settle, not on mount; pager wrapper height-clamps to the active page via ResizeObserver so short tabs don't inherit the tallest page's scroll length); foreign profile: posts list only — no switcher, no swipe, Saved/Liked are private and not shown; content scrolls in an inner div so dock and sheet stay pinned; profile/elo/posts via useSWR (/api/users/{username}/profile, /elo, /api/feed/user/{username}) — revisits render cached instantly with silent background refresh; BottomNav (profile active)
    search/
      page.tsx                  pill search input; one debounced (300ms) search fetches /api/search and /api/search/users in parallel; Posts|Accounts SegmentedTabs capsule appears once a query exists and switches (tap or swipe, useSwipeTabs 2-page pager) which fetched list shows; posts page: format chips (server-side filter, re-fires the search) + frosted slab result cards; accounts page: slab rows with Avatar, verified badge, bio and follow/unfollow pill; stage-pulse loading slabs; BottomNav (search active)
    create/
      page.tsx                  3-step creation wizard for all 7 formats in Stage: step 1 — 7 frosted format cards (selected = accent border + brighter fill); step 2 — duplicate check (slab result rows); step 3 — Books: full wizard with Feed Card block + 15 section accordion slabs (Required/Optional pill badges, 9 required / 6 optional); all other formats: format-specific feed card fields + body textarea (stored as heart section) + shared quiz + sources; inner list items and feed-card blocks = frosted rounded-2xl/3xl fills, interest pills neutral active fill; submits {format, title, feed_card, sections, interests} to POST /api/posts; on success invalidates the cached feed lists; /api/interests via useSWR (static list, cached across visits); slab login gate + success screen linking to /my-posts; BottomNav (create active)
    chat/
      page.tsx                  conversation list (avatar, name, last-message preview, relative time; rows brighten on hover with white/5% fill) via useSWR (revisits render cached instantly, background refetch keeps new messages appearing) + New chat overlay (pill user search via /api/search/users, frosted multi-select chips, optional group name); Stage slab login/empty states + stage-pulse loading rows; BottomNav (chat active)
      [id]/
        page.tsx                conversation view: history via GET messages, live updates over the websocket, own messages right (bg-white/14% ink bubble), others left (bg-surface-2, matching comment bubbles), sender labels in groups, borderless header/input bars, stage-pulse bubble loading, textarea send (Enter sends, max 2000 chars), connection status in header
    my-posts/
      page.tsx                  lists the current user's own posts as frosted slab rows with cover thumbnail (from feed_card.cover_url), title, author, format badge, status pill, timestamps; stage-pulse loading rows; fetches GET /api/posts/mine; empty state links to /create; BottomNav (create active)
    saved-posts/
      page.tsx                  bookmarked posts: reads IDs from localStorage via getSavedPostIds, fetches each via GET /api/posts/{id} (auth optional; pending author-only posts load correctly), renders as full-screen snap-scroll PostCards; skips missing/deleted posts silently; slab empty state with bookmark icon + stage-pulse loading slabs; BottomNav (profile active)
    post/
      [id]/
        page.tsx                full-screen detail page in Stage; floating frosted back circle (btn-icon); header = frosted slab inset mx-3 with SlabGlow format halo behind it (container-width box, small vertical bleed so the back circle keeps a near-black backdrop) and SlabAccent left-edge bar (accent format marker dot + accent lowercase mono label, cover image for Books, title, author, attribution, interest pills); SectionRenderer renders sections in order (body untouched); floating pill comment bar detached left-3/right-3 12px above the safe-area bottom: pill input + circular arrow-up submit + bare like heart circle, no count (liked bg-like/10; save/share live on the feed rail, not here); loading = stage-pulse slabs, not-found = slab message; slide-up animation, swipe-right-to-close; attribution: Submitted by @user (blue verified badge) for user content; Deepscroll + violet badge for seed/official; comment add/delete writes the new count through to the cached feed lists
    components/
      icons.tsx                  Stage glyph set (Heart/Comment/Bookmark/ArrowUp/Send/Speaker): soft rounded outline forms, strokeWidth 1.8, filled prop turns closed shapes solid for liked/saved; ArrowUp = comment submit (distinct from the Send paper plane, which is share-only on the feed rail); used by the feed action rail, detail bar, comments sheet and saved-posts empty state; BottomNav keeps its own NAV_ICONS
      FeedHeader.tsx             Stage feed header: floating frosted capsule tab strip (h-11 rounded-full bg-white/6% blur) detached from the top edge + separate frosted search circle; neutral pill indicator (h-9 bg-white/10%) slides as the active fill; accent appears only as the format dot on the active tab label; scroll-sync refs come from page.tsx's useSwipeTabs instance (buttons keyed by index)
      SegmentedTabs.tsx          Stage equal-width segmented capsule (h-11 rounded-full bg-white/6% blur, p-1) with a sliding indicator pill (h-9 bg-white/12%, starts width 0) wired to a useSwipeTabs instance; replaces the per-button static active fill on stats/profile/search switchers
      PostCard.tsx               full-screen snap card in Stage: format marker above the slab (10px accent dot + accent lowercase mono label) over a borderless frosted slab (.card px-6 py-7) holding the format-aware content; exports SlabGlow (static per-card format-accent radial halo behind the slab — radial-gradient color-mix 8% → transparent 70%, clipped by the card's overflow-hidden so chrome stays neutral; hard color switch on snap because each card owns its glow); exports SlabAccent (3px accent bar on the slab's left edge + faint accent tint falling from the top edge, clipped into the rounded corners — edge accent, not a border or fill; also used by the detail header slab); kicker lines inside the slab (field/role/era_label) are accent label-caps; teasers as typography-only bullet rows directly on the slab (17px full-ink text + accent dots, mt-2 below the title layer, space-y rhythm — no panel, border or vertical line, never button-shaped); CardFooter inside the slab = Avatar (author_avatar_url) + @username + VerifiedBadge byline and neutral DotScale + "N min · extras" mono meta line; interest tags as two floating frosted pills bottom-left; read-aloud placeholder (disabled speaker glyph, no handler) sits at the right end of the format-marker row — the post block's top-right, not in the social rail; action rail = bare glyphs right edge (like/comment/save/share, w-7 glyphs in w-11 tap targets, springy active:scale-90; items carry a fixed h-3 count slot — mono count inside, invisible when zero; the last item has no trailing slot — so button centers sit at one uniform interval; rail and interest tags bottom-anchor at safe-area + 72px, 4px above the nav dock top, bottoms aligned via flex-wrap-reverse on the tag container); re-exports Post type; format styles from lib/formats.ts; comment-count changes from the bottom sheet write through to the cached feed lists (updatePostInFeedCaches)
      BottomNav.tsx              Stage floating dock: frosted pill (h-14 rounded-full bg-white/6% blur) inset left-4/right-4 and 12px above the safe-area bottom; Chat / Stats / Feed / Create / Profile items built as a NavItem[] array with NAV_ICONS svg content (stats = line-chart glyph: axes + rising trend, replacing the signal-bar rects); active item = neutral filled circle (bg-white/12%), no glow; pages clear it with pb-24; prefetches the sibling routes on mount so the first tap skips the route-chunk download (incl. the ~517 KB recharts chunk for /stats)
      Providers.tsx              "use client" boundary; wraps children with AuthProvider + SWRConfig (jsonFetcher as default fetcher; focus/reconnect revalidation off to keep request patterns unchanged) so layout.tsx stays a Server Component
    lib/
      eventQueue.ts             module-level batch queue; flushes every 5s or at 5 events to POST /api/events with Authorization header when token present; exports hasPendingLike/cancelPendingLike so unlike-before-flush can cancel an in-flight event; deduplicates "like" events per post_id within the current queue
      auth.tsx                  AuthContext + AuthProvider: stores JWT in localStorage under "deepscroll_token", restores session via /api/auth/me on load, exposes user/login/register/logout/updateUser/loading; normalizes FastAPI string/array error details; clears the SWR cache on login/register/logout so no cached data crosses accounts
      api.ts                    apiFetch wrapper: prepends NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, attaches Authorization: Bearer header when token present; skips Content-Type for FormData bodies
      swr.ts                    SWR cache plumbing: jsonFetcher (apiFetch-backed, throws ApiError with status), clearApiCache() global wipe used by auth.tsx; updatePostInFeedCaches(postId, patch) patches a post in all cached /api/feed* lists (comment-count write-through), invalidateFeedCaches() drops them (called after post creation)
      relativeTime.ts           shared relativeTime(iso) formatter (just now / Nm / Nh / Nd / short date)
      useComments.ts            comment list state hook (fetch/post/delete, loadedRef count guard) shared by CommentsBottomSheet and the post detail page
      useSwipeTabs.ts           shared swipe-to-switch-tabs hook (extracted from the feed): horizontal scroll-snap pager + scroll-synced sliding indicator (left/width interpolated between index-keyed tab buttons), scrollend commit with 50ms debounce fallback, activatedIndices Set for lazy page mounting, selectTab click-to-scroll, ResizeObserver realigns scrollLeft on resize, refreshIndicator() re-measures when tab buttons mount late
      chatSocket.ts             useChatSocket hook: one ws per page, http→ws url derivation, first-frame JWT auth, auto-reconnect (3s), send(conversationId, body); exports ChatMessage/Conversation types + MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS
      likedPosts.ts             isPostLiked, likePost, unlikePost, getLikedPostIds; localStorage key "deepscroll_liked"; getCachedLikeCount/setCachedLikeCount; key "deepscroll_like_counts"; isLikeSent/markLikeSent/unmarkLikeSent; key "deepscroll_like_sent" tracks posts whose like event reached the backend — used in the server-count reconciliation formula; one-time migration seeds sent-key from liked-key; server-safe; TODO: replace with backend endpoint
      savedPosts.ts             isPostSaved, savePost, unsavePost, getSavedPostIds; localStorage key "deepscroll_saved"; server-safe; TODO: replace with backend endpoint
  src/lib/
    formats.ts                  single source of format identity: FORMAT_IDS, FORMAT_STYLES (label, badge, Circuit ink hex, rgb, text/dot/border/indicator classes from fmt-* tokens), formatStyle() with neutral fallback, LEGACY_SVG_ACCENT_MAP (old accent hex → new ink, used by SvgBlock)
  src/components/

## ELO KNOWLEDGE SCORE

Standard Elo: R' = R + K * (S - E), E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Q - R) / 400)). Each quiz question is an
opponent rated by the post's difficulty (1→800, 2→1000, 3→1200; default 1000). Correct answers
gain points, wrong answers always lose points so guessing has a cost. K=32 for the first 30
answers in a format (fast convergence), K=16 after (stable). Ratings start at 1000, floored at
100, one rating per format; the global score is the average of per-format ratings. A question
can only ever be scored once per user (DB unique constraint) and answering your own post never
moves your rating, so replays and self-quizzing cannot farm Elo. answer_index/explanation are
stripped from API post payloads; correctness is decided only server-side.

## CHAT / WEBSOCKET DESIGN

One socket per client at WS /api/chat/ws serves all of that user's conversations; the server
routes by participant lookup, the client never subscribes to anything. Auth is a first frame
{type:"auth", token} validated with the existing JWT decode + is_active check (token stays out
of URLs and logs; browsers cannot set WS headers). Plain ws:// is refused (4403) unless the
client is local or x-forwarded-proto says https — production must run wss behind TLS. Sending
goes through the socket only ({type:"send"}); persistence happens before broadcast, and the
sender's echo doubles as the delivery confirmation. Participant-only authorization is re-checked
in the DB on every send and every REST call; non-participants get 404/error indistinguishable
from nonexistent conversations. Conversation creation requires an accepted follow in either
direction with every target (so private accounts are unreachable until they approve). DMs are
deduplicated per user pair; groups hold 2-19 targets + creator. Messages: plain text 1-2000
chars, 30/min per user; no E2E encryption by design (would split DM/group into two systems and
break moderation). ConnectionManager and rate limits are in-process — fine single-worker,
needs Redis pub/sub for multi-worker. Deliberate scope cuts: no read receipts, no typing

See SECURITY_REVIEW.md (June 2026) for the full audit: what was fixed vs accepted vs open decisions.

Comment body is untrusted user input stored as plain text. React's default JSX text rendering
writes to the DOM via `.textContent`, which the browser treats as literal characters — `<script>`
becomes `&lt;script&gt;` and cannot execute. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` bypasses this by injecting
raw HTML directly into the DOM, enabling XSS if the string contains `<script>` tags or event
attributes. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render comment text.

### User-uploaded file security

- **SVG sanitized twice**: upload endpoint (sanitize_svg) + post creation (sanitize_svg_text) as defense-in-depth
- **SVG rendering**: user SVGs (is_user_content=true) rendered as `<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,…">` — JavaScript cannot execute in image context. Official/seed SVGs may use dangerouslySetInnerHTML (controlled pipeline); marked with a comment in PostCard.tsx and post/[id]/page.tsx
- **Image re-encoding**: Pillow converts to RGB and re-saves at quality=85, stripping steganographic payloads and ICC profiles
- **Magic-byte check**: file bytes inspected before Pillow to reject non-image content disguised with an image extension
- **Animated GIFs**: rejected outright (hard to sanitize safely)
- **UUID filenames**: upload filenames always UUID-generated — user-provided filenames are never used (prevents path traversal like `../../etc/passwd`)
- **Upload directory**: absolute path outside backend/ (`user_uploads/` at repo root) — files are never on Python's module search path
- **image_url validation**: user-submitted posts must use the Supabase storage URL prefix (`{SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/uploads/`) — no arbitrary external image URLs accepted
- **File size enforced via chunked reads**: Content-Length header is not trusted; reads stop as soon as the running total exceeds the limit
- **Rate limits**: 10 image uploads/hr, 10 SVG uploads/hr, 20 post submissions/day per user (in-memory, no external dependency)

## CURRENT STATUS

**Built**
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL (Supabase), CORS, full API
- Section-based post schema: feed_card JSON + sections JSON array; old per-format fields removed
- 15 section types for Books format (validated via Pydantic v2 discriminated union)
- Seed script: 145 interests + auto-discovers all *_example.json files (currently Books + Facts + People); FORMAT_INTEREST_SLUGS maps format → interests; _post_title falls back to feed_card.name for People
- Legacy DB preserved as backend/deepscroll.db.legacy_*
- Onboarding: interest picker → slugs saved to localStorage → gates feed
- Feed: 9-tab horizontal swipe (For You + Following + 7 formats) + vertical snap scroll per tab
- Quiz + Elo: interactive quizzes, server-validated answers, per-format + global knowledge score (see ELO KNOWLEDGE SCORE)
- Profiles: avatar upload, knowledge score, follower/following lists, account search, follow UI end-to-end
- EmptyState component for format tabs with no posts yet
- Books feed card: cover, title, author, essence, 3 teasers, difficulty DotScale, year/genre
- Detail page: SectionRenderer renders 34 section types (15 Books + 10 Facts + 9 People) in order (SVG security: dangerouslySetInnerHTML for seed, base64 img for user)
- Create page: 3-step Books wizard with Feed Card block + interest picker (1–5) + 15 section accordions
- My-posts page: cover thumbnail + title + author + status from feed_card
- User accounts: JWT auth, register/login, follow system, public profiles, comments, likes, saves
- Stats page, verification system, saved posts
- Real-time chat: DMs + group chats over WebSocket (see CHAT / WEBSOCKET DESIGN), conversation list + chat view, chat in bottom nav (search moved top-right)
- Security hardening pass (June 2026, see SECURITY_REVIEW.md)
- "Stage" visual identity (June 2026, see docs/DESIGN.md): single design consolidated from the three-way exploration; Circuit neutral tokens in globals.css unchanged, component vocabulary redefined as borderless frosted slabs + detached pill chrome + springy press feedback; accents only on small post-owned elements (format dot, teaser bullets, tab dot, in-body --accent), hard accent switch on snap-settle in mixed feeds; per-post --accent CSS variable replaces hardcoded section colors; seed SVGs re-paletted at render time in SvgBlock (content JSON untouched); shared component vocabulary (.card/.btn/.btn-icon/.field/.chip/.label-caps); read-aloud placeholder reserved in the feed action rail (disabled, no functionality yet)

**Next**
- Content for academy format
- Recommendation algorithm improvements
- Pagination / infinite scroll
